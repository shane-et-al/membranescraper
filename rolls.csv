Roll A 1a: April 1323 - Aug 1326,Membrane 1,No date,"Letter from the Mayor to the Earl of Kent, acknowledging his request of 20 Jan. for a force of 50 arbalesters for service against the Castle of Wallingford (fn. 1), which was then held by rebels. The matter had been laid before the Commonalty, who replied that it was impossible to raise the men, because the citizens had undertaken to hold the City for the King, as surety for which the Queen and her children were dwelling in London, and the duty of guarding the City against sudden surprise, as well as losses by piracy at sea, had greatly impoverished the citizens. (F)"
Roll A 1a: April 1323 - Aug 1326,Membrane 1,1323/04/06,"The King's writ (fn. 2) to the Mayor and Sheriffs, to the effect that the people of middle condition in the City [mediocris populi] had complained of interference by the Mayor and Sheriffs with their ancient right of selling small wares at the head of Cheap in the evening, whereby their livelihood was taken from them.

Roll A 1a: April 1323 - Aug 1326,Membrane 1,1323/07/28,"Further writ with regard to sales during the evening hours at Cornhill. A presentment had been made before Hervey de Staunton and the other Itinerant Justices at the Tower that Simon Ricongey and others had sold old clothes, shoes and other goods by night at Cornhill in deception of the people, although such sales were lawful only between sunrise and noon, and judgment had been given that in future these goods should not be exposed for sale after vespers struck at the Church of St Thomas the Martyr of Acon. Owing to subsequent complaints, the Mayor and Aldermen had been several times ordered to proceed against offenders, but had been remiss in levying the fines due from them to the King, on the ground that these writs had been obtained by John Waldeshef (fn. 3) against the liberty of the City, to which jurisdiction in this matter and the fines arising therefrom were claimed to belong. Moreover the above John, although he had no part in obtaining the writs, had been removed from the counsel of the City, forbidden to practise in the Courts, and deprived of the pension which he had enjoyed. Accordingly the Mayor and Aldermen are commanded to revoke their measures against him, and to collect the fines due to the King without delay, any question as to the latter being reserved for the consideration of the King's Court.

The writers report that on Stratford's arrival in London they had seized nineteen Bulls, of which five were patent and three close. The Bishop had forbidden them to look at these Bulls, because they related to the King's private affairs, which he had in charge. Accordingly they had forwarded them to the King under their seals. Nine other Bulls Close were directed on the covers to the Queen, the Prelates and other magnates of the realm. These also had been sealed and would be delivered to the King by a serjeant. (F)"

For this purpose weights, balances and weighing-houses had been provided, for the upkeep of which a toll of one halfpenny on each quarter weighed had been imposed. By a subsequent writ, Edw. I had confirmed these ordinances. Recently, however, the bakers and millers had sued before Geoffrey le Scrope and his fellow-Justices for the abolition of the toll and pesage.

In answer to previous letters, the Mayor etc. of Northampton had declared that the wine had been taken without payment from the above Philip by the Earl Marshal at the tournament in Northampton, that Philip would pay anything due as soon as account had been rendered between himself and John, and that the authorities of Northampton could not force a man to pay a debt except by process of law. The writers now wish to point out that Philip had acknowledged the debt, which was further witnessed by a tally for 16 marks, of which 20s had been paid, so that no further rendering of account was necessary. As for the plea that the burgesses of Northampton were bound by the common law not to distrain for a debt except by process of law, the writers would have them know that the citizens of London were entitled by their franchises (fn. 7) to take distresses from the fellow-citizens or fellow-burgesses of debtors. Accordingly once more they desire the authorities of Northampton to take steps against the above Philip, who was a fellow-burgess of theirs and under their jurisdiction. (F)"

The writers understood that the City believed, on the strength of a letter from the Mayor of York, that Richard Betoyne (fn. 31) had advocated the removal of the Staple abroad, and claimed by a charter the office of Mayor of the Staple overseas. They wish to testify that the said Richard attended an assembly of the ""Commune"" of merchants in the Chapter House at York, at which the writers and Richard de Edelmeton, William atte Pole and other merchants from 28 towns were present, when they discussed the Staple, as they were instructed to do by the Chancellor. The merchants had put it to Richard de Betoyne that he was their Mayor and he had denied it (susmistrent au dit Richard de Bettoyne estre lour metre et il respoundit qe noun), whereupon they answered him that he ought to go and lay down his mayoralty in the place where he took it up, and surrender the charters, which had cost them dear. To this he replied that John de Charletone (fn. 32) had the charter of their franchises and detained it, but that he had himself, four years ago, caused a transcript to be made, which he was ready to surrender if they wished. At this point, the Mayor of York suddenly appeared, hand in hand with John de Charletone, with three or four others of their party and several members of the Commune of York, on which Richard de Betoyne said he would not stay in any place where John de Charletone was taken into counsel, and he got up and left and did not return to the Council of the merchants. For this reason Richard de Edelmeton and the rest were angry with him. This was all that happened, and the writers have no knowledge of any misconduct on the part of Richard de Betoyne, and are grieved that stories to his discredit should have been reported by the Mayor of York. On the contrary they had found the said Richard always zealous to carry out the wishes of the City. As regards news, they report the arrival of the French envoys, who had not given any answer. The Scottish envoys were on the way, and the Council was sitting daily to promote an agreement among the magnates. Letters had come to the King and Queen, announcing the death of the King of France.

He had only been in the company of the merchants at York on one occasion, when they put it to him that he was Mayor of the Staple (mistrent sur que ieo fu meire de les Estaples) and wished to have counsel with him, and he had answered that he did not consider himself their Mayor, and had not come to counsel them, but that John de Graham (fn. 33) and John Priour were present, in accordance with the writs, to deal with the matter of the Staple. The merchants then charged him by the oath he had taken overseas that he should go abroad and lay down his mayoralty in the place where he had received it, together with their charters and muniments, which had cost them dear. He had replied that he had left the charters on the other side of the sea with their other things on his departure thence, except their charter of the franchises of the Staples, purchased from the late King, which was in the hands of John de Charleton, who detained it, but he had had a copy made at Dover in the 18th year of King Edward, the King's father, when the latter was at that place; and he offered it to the merchants. He encloses a copy for the information of the City of London. As a proof of the ill-will entertained towards him by the men of York, he mentions that the Mayor of York appeared maliciously and without warning, with four or five of his livery, and led in his enemy, John de Charletone, dressed in their livery as a burgess of York, and with them were a great many of the Commune of York. As soon as the writer saw him, he told the Mayor that he would neither sit nor remain in the place where John de Charleton was, and he rose and went out, for he would certainly never make peace with the said John without the consent of the commonalty of London. He had not been in the company of the merchants since and had no certain knowledge what answer they made to the King's Council. Accordingly he prays the City to put aside its anger against him. Dated at York, 12 Feb. In a postscript he adds that the Mayor of York and several other burgesses of York came to his lodging on the eve of the Purification and accused him of having come to York only to spy on their fellow-burgess, John de Charletone, in order to do him harm, all of which he had denied. The writer considered that this insult (vileynie) was directed not only against himself but also against the City, whose messenger he was. (F)"

Cambs. The plaintiffs had alleged that the men of the hundred had allowed the robbers to escape, to which the men of the hundred had replied that within fifteen days several evildoers had been apprehended and placed in the King's prison at Cambridge, on account of which the hundred was not bound to answer for the robbery. A precept had been sent to the Mayor and Bailiffs of Cambridge and a certificate returned, and the parties had appeared in Chancery, being subsequently ordered to come before the King in Parliament at Salisbury, and by adjournment before Geoffrey le Scrope and the other Justices in the King's Bench. The men of the hundred, represented by William Avenel, knight, and others, averred that the returns of the Sheriff, the Coroners and the Mayor and Bailiffs of Cambridge [saying that no persons suspected of the robbery had been apprehended] were false, and that as a matter of fact Ralph le Thresher and other thieves had been arrested and detained at Cambridge.

Roll A 1b: (iii) Aug 1328 - Aug 1335,Membr. 31,1328/12/16,"Letter from the King to the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs and Commonalty of London, informing them that he had recently sent to the Earl of Lancaster certain messages, a copy of which accompanies this letter. On receiving the messages the Earl had replied that he would take advice and give an answer, but instead of doing so he had moved from Leicester to Kenilworth and was now advancing in force against the King, to whom he would have done an injury, if he could have taken him unawares. Though the Earl and his party declared that they were acting in the King's interests, and that their movements were directed not against him, but against certain of his subjects, the King considered that their proceedings would result in grave disorder, and thus directly affected him. In any case, it was not their duty, but his, to act as judge and do justice. He appeals to the City, which he regards as the ""King's Chamber,"" not to show favour to the Earl or assist him in any way. He desires the Mayor to proclaim publicly the tenour of the messages which he had sent to the Earl. Dated at Gloucester, 16 Dec. Ao 2 Edw. III [1328]. (F) Copy of the above-mentioned messages: Recently Ralph Basset and William de Clynton had come to the King at Westminster and had suggested that an agreement was possible if the Earl of Lancaster and the Earl of March (fn. 21) could discuss their differences together, and had prayed the King to give orders to his Council to arrange a meeting. To this the King had answered that the measures taken by the Earl of Lancaster were a trespass against himself, and amends should be made to him alone. Though it was not a King's duty to send messengers to his subjects, nevertheless for the preservation of the peace, he now informs the Earl of the following points on which he feels himself aggrieved, in order that the Earl may be better disposed to make his submission. In the first place, it was agreed at the Parliament of Northampton (fn. 22) by the prelates and wise men of the Council, and by them proposed to the King, the Earls and other magnates, that the King was the rightful heir of France according to written and Canon law, and he was advised to send two Bishops to France to claim his right. By general consent, to which the Earl of Lancaster was a party, the Bishops of Chester and Worcester were chosen, and thereupon the Earl and those present in Parliament promised to aid the King to the utmost of their power. Item, it was agreed at the same Parliament that Justices should be commissioned for the several counties to deal with felonies and trespasses, that the magnates in their districts should assist them to do justice and should not maintain or protect evildoers, and that no one, great or small, should go armed in the Kingdom, under penalty of forfeiture of their arms and imprisonment. Item, it was agreed that the King should live of his own; and forthwith a Chancellor, Treasurer, Steward of the Household and other ministers were appointed. It was also agreed that the Earl of Lancaster should remain near the King to counsel and aid him, and that no important business should be done without the Earl—which duties the Earl undertook loyally to perform."
Roll A 1b: (iii) Aug 1328 - Aug 1335,Membr. 31b,1328/12/16,"Nevertheless, in spite of these ordinances and promises the Earl had removed himself from the King and his Council, except on one occasion, when he came to the King at Warwick and promised to attend the Council at Worcester. But at Worcester the Earl was unwilling that the dispatch of men to Guyenne should take place until the matter had been considered at a larger Council, which he advised the King to summon to York (fn. 23). The Earl, however, had not attended at York, sending letters to excuse himself, with the result that the business of Gascony and other important matters were delayed, whereupon the King took the advice of those who were present and summoned Parliament to meet at Salisbury, to which place he arranged his journey by way of Lincoln, Norfolk and London. On the way the Earl had appeared at Barlyngs (fn. 24) with a retinue of armed and mounted men, to the great displeasure of the King, who ordered him by word of mouth to attend the Parliament at Salisbury. After his departure, the Earl sent the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Wake to the Guildhall of London, in which City there was always a large number of visiting aliens, and these messengers, in the presence of the Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen and the whole Commonalty and also of many aliens (fn. 25), declared that the King was badly advised, had no good council round him, had not the wherewithal to live, and paid nothing for the expenses of his household—all of which was reported abroad, at the Court of Rome and in France and elsewhere, to the great slander of the King and his Council and in hindrance of the King's affairs in France and Gascony. After this, the Earl assembled men-at-arms at Hegham Ferers (fn. 26), news of which was carried to the King at Cambridge (fn. 27). In order to avoid the Earl he had turned aside from his journey to London and had joined the Queen-Mother and the Queen, staying in their company till Salisbury was reached. The Earl did not attend the Parliament there, but sent certain knights as his proctors to lay before the King his reasons for not coming—which reasons seemed to many in Parliament invalid. However, the Bishops, who did not wish to say openly that the excuses given were unacceptable, prayed the King not to accept them for the time being, but to wait quietly till the whole Council was met together; their reasons being that the Bishop of Winchester was not present among the other prelates when the Earl of Lancaster's non-arrival was discussed. Subsequently the Bishop appeared and told the prelates, earls and barons that he knew well that the Earl had not come because of the quarrel between himself and Lord Mortimer. The Earl had heard, he said, that Lord Mortimer had made peace in Scotland, in order to destroy him (the Earl). The Bishop added that if an agreement could be reached between the Earl and Mortimer all would be well. These remarks were reported to the King, in whose presence Lord Mortimer, now Earl of March, had defended himself from the Bishop's aspersions. The prelates and others there were satisfied with his defence, and afterwards by the King's command and at the request of the prelates, earls and barons in Parliament, Mortimer took an oath on the cross of the Archbishop of Canterbury that he would neither do, nor procure to be done, any harm to the Earl of Lancaster and his party. On the prayer of the prelates, the Bishops of Winchester and London were sent to the Earl to report these events to him, and to invite him to attend Parliament, the King adding a verbal message that he wished the Earl and his party to come in safety, though he did not desire the presence of Sir Henry de Beaumond (fn. 28) on this occasion, and that if the Earl distrusted any person of the King's entourage, the King would give him surety. Meanwhile these delays and the upholding of business were regarded as a great hardship by those attending Parliament, especially as they had been put to great expense on previous occasions, when nothing was done. However, the Bishops returned at length with the Earl's answer to the following effect: The Earl denied that he was moved by any desire to profit himself, or by any hatred of others, and declared that it was in the interest of the Church, the King and the realm, that certain abuses should be remedied. The King ought to have enough of his own to live fitly, without oppressing the people, together with treasure for defending his land and people if need arose. Moreover the Queen-consort ought to have her dowry on which to live without grieving the people (fn. 29). Peers of the realm had been chosen at the Parliament at Westminster after the King's coronation to advise him during his youthful years, which counsellors were to be responsible for their actions to the next Parliament. The peace of the realm, without which the King could not be lord or King, ought to be maintained. In order to recommend these matters and give such assistance as he could, the Earl would come to Parliament, but he begged the prelates and others to excuse him to the King for coming with an armed force, since his motive for so doing was not any desire to disobey the King or to harm any one, but merely to protect himself against those who were notoriously anxious to do him a wrong. If the King considered that he should come in any other wise, because of the danger of conflict, he prayed the prelates and magnates to obtain from the King letters of safe-conduct for himself and his party. The above answer being considered by the King, it seemed to him as regards the first point, namely, that he ought to live of his own, that it was impossible for him to be any richer, since both he and his people were impoverished by the present disturbances, but if any man knew how to make him richer, it would give him and his advisers great satisfaction. As regards the Queen-consort's dowry, this ought not to be a reason for disturbance, since the matter concerned himself and her alone. It would not be an increased charge, and so he was willing that it should be done. As to the point that the King should be counselled by the peers of the realm, summons had frequently been sent to the Earl, but he had been unwilling to come and had removed himself from the King. As regards the maintenance of the law and peace, this was the sovereign desire of the King himself, and he wished above all things to maintain them, as he was bound by his oath to do. In the matter of the safe-conduct, though it was not customary for Kings in the past to issue such letters to their subjects in the realm, nevertheless at the request of the Queen-Mother, the prelates, the King's uncle the Earl of Kent, and others, the King had granted them in the form demanded, under the condition that the Earl and his party would answer at law, since the King could not issue any other kind of safe-conduct without offence to the Great Charter, which laid down that the King should not deny or delay right or justice to any man. These letters of safe-conduct were not accepted by the Earl, nor did he attend Parliament. Accordingly the King, in view of the long delays which had taken place, with the assent of the prelates, earls and barons, and at the request of the knights of the Commons, on Monday the eve of All Saints [1 Nov.] adjourned his Parliament to the octave of the Purification next ensuing at Westminster. He then arranged to make his journey by Winchester to London, when news was brought to him that the Earl of Lancaster with others had entered the City of Winchester with a great force of men-at-arms and foot-men, and had gathered to himself large numbers of men in a warlike manner. Thereupon the King ordered the Sheriff of Southampton to hasten to Winchester in order to arrest all men carrying arms against the King's prohibition and the Statute of Northampton. The Sheriff conveyed his orders to Lord Wake, but the Earl's party stood their ground and did not obey the King's servant until the Thursday following, although the Parliament was adjourned and the members had departed on leave, On Thursday the King journeyed as arranged to Winchester, when the Earl and his armed following left the City and passed by the side of the King, which was seen by some of the King's household, who told him what they saw—an action which the King regarded with great displeasure as being done against the peace and his own honour, and in despite of him. Nevertheless the King, being anxious that peace should be maintained, desires to bring all these facts to the notice of the Earl, that the Earl may be advised to behave towards the King as he ought to behave to his liege lord. The King assures the Earl that if he does so, he will find him gracious and ready to promote unity and concord between all as a just judge, and not as a partisan. (F)"

Moreover the King well knew that divers councils of the prelates of the realm had given sentence of excommunication against all persons (with the exception of the King, the Queen and their children) who were guilty of disturbing the peace, or causing it to be disturbed. Since it was now common knowledge that the King had been advised to advance in force against certain peers and others of the land, to the great peril of the realm, the Archbishop earnestly prays and admonishes the King to desist from these intentions until the meeting of Parliament at Westminster, at which any peer or other who had offended might make amends and be punished according to due process of law.

Excuses are to be made for the non-attendance of the Chancellor, who is in charge of the Great Seal and cannot be spared from his duties. Those present are to be informed that the King had received information that the King of France intended to send military aid to the Scots, and this information had been confirmed by the fact that ships had been pressed into service along the French shores as far as the coast of Brittany for transporting troops. Since there was danger of these ships making a descent upon the English coast, the King and Council had appointed Sir John Howard as Admiral from the mouth of the Thames northwards, and Sir John de Cobham from the same place southwards, and in addition had constituted certain persons as wardens of the maritime counties, and others to enlist and command defensive forces, as would appear by their commissions. Commands had also been sent to the Barons of the Cinque Ports and the authorities of other ports to put their towns in a posture of defence, and commissioners had been sent to the seaports to ensure that this was being done. News had also been received that at the Parliament of Paris held on the Octave of St Mary Magdalene [22 July] last, the King of France had announced by word of mouth that he desired to aid the Scots with a thousand men-at-arms and a large number of other troops, and a suitable escort of ships, pretending that he was bound so to do by virtue of a perpetual treaty of alliance between the two kingdoms. Writs had immediately been issued to summon the bishops and others to London to discuss the contents of the writs and other matters, which would be laid before them by the King's messengers. The Chancellor, Treasurer and other councillors, in order to facilitate the discussion of these matters by the prelates and nobles, had divided the kingdom into three parts: from the Trent northwards including the county of Lincoln; from the Trent southwards; and the Marches of Wales. They had summoned the prelates etc. from the first part to meet at York, where it was agreed that all men of a certain age should be armed, and should resist any landing of the French, in whichever of the three parts it should occur. Sir Ralph Basset had then been ordered to take a commission issued to the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, Hereford and Worcester, Sir John de Cherleton and himself to hold a similar council for the Marches of Wales; and afterwards to come to London to explain what had been done at York and in Wales, so that the Council at London, which represented that part of England from the Trent southwards, might give its consent or add anything necessary, in order that the measures adopted might be carried out unanimously. Further orders had been given to the Admirals, the Barons of the Cinque Ports, and the men of other ports, to fit out and put afloat their ships for the protection of the coasts; and three chief captains, one from each part of the kingdom, had been chosen and commissioned for the purpose.

The Mayor and Aldermen being dissatisfied with the verdict, which they considered to be unreasonable and untrue, adjourned the matter and took counsel together as to the best course to pursue.

The ordinance having been read in the presence of the cappers aforesaid, a certain Richard de Byry, a capper, shouted out that he would continue to do as he had done before, in spite of it; and he was thereupon committed to Newgate.

Roll A 6: 1349-50,Membr. 7,1350/06/28,"Pleas held before the Mayor, Aldermen and Sheriffs on Monday the eve of SS. Peter and Paul [29 June] A bill of complaint was read in which the Commonalty of the land (la Comune de la terre) (fn. 15) charged the Fusters of the City, viz. Geoffrey Owyt, John Dunmowe, Thomas Payn, Robert Payn, John de Enfeld, Walter Brok, John Payn and Peter Dunmowe, with forming a confederacy and agreeing not to sell a saddle-tree (arson), which used to cost 6d or 7d, for less than 2s or 30d, although the wood of which it was made cost only 3d. They complained further that the Fusters had agreed not to take any apprentices, with the intention of restricting the number of their mistery, so that they could control prices. They also agreed to sell their saddle-bows to foreigners, if they could not obtain their price among citizens, and they were about to buy a charter from the King restricting the trade to those persons who were now confederated, which would result in the decrease of the mistery. A similar confederacy had formerly existed among the lorimers in copper, of whom there were now only two left to serve the whole people. (F) The Fusters were attached to appear on Wednesday, when they pleaded not guilty, and one of them, Robert Payn, said he had taken an apprentice, Nicholas de Eston, and enrolled him within the last half year. On Friday a jury found that the Fusters were selling saddle-trees for 40d, though wood cost no more than formerly, that they had agreed in words, though not on oath, to raise the price of their work and to sell to foreigners if citizens would not buy, but that they were not guilty of refusing apprentices or seeking a charter. Judgment was given that they be committed to prison during the pleasure of the Mayor and Aldermen. (L) On Monday after the Feast of the Translation of St Thomas the Martyr [7 July] the above-mentioned Fusters came into court, when William Pykerel on behalf of the Saddlers of the City produced a bill purporting to be an agreement by the good men of the Commonalty of the land, who had prosecuted the Fusters. They suggested that owing to the mischief caused by the Pestilence during the last two years, a new scale of charges for goods supplied by the Fusters to the Saddlers should be adopted for a half year, one year or two years, and that prices should revert to the former level or even lower as times (le seclee) improved. They demanded further that all saddle-trees should be of good material, that the Fusters should take apprentices, and that they should not sell to foreigners so long as there was a sale among citizens. (F) After deliberating on these proposals of the Saddlers, the Fusters handed in a bill, in which they said that owing to a life of labour they were now feeble in strength, that they could not find apprentices or serving men to help them, and that at a time when they needed more comfort in the matter of food and clothing, conditions were so evil that the gallon of beer cost 2d instead of 1d, and other necessaries had also risen in like proportion. Consequently they could not sell at the prices suggested by the Saddlers, since they would be spending more in a year than they could earn in three. As regards selling to foreigners and citizens, they possessed the same rights as other freemen, and the proposals of the Saddlers were in prejudice of their liberties. They prayed the Mayor and Aldermen to accept a schedule of prices for certain kinds of saddle-trees. (F) After consideration, and putting aside the arguments of both the Saddlers and the Fusters, the Mayor and Aldermen ordained certain prices for three kinds of saddle-trees, which were to be paid until affairs improved. These prices were accepted both by the Saddlers and the Fusters, and the latter swore to observe them.

Accordingly the petitioner prayed Sir William de Wykham to order the Recorder to examine the matter, so that it might be shown to be a usurious bargain, for which the said Peter had already received part payment; and in any case all liability had been assumed by Sir Nicholas de Lovaigne for John Monde (fn. 15), wherefore the petitioner ought to be discharged from the suit. (F) On receipt of these letters, the Mayor and Aldermen summoned the parties, who appeared. Peter de Mildenhale denied the allegations made against him and demanded to acquit himself by the verdict of a jury. Subsequently the petitioner failed to appear, but the Court decided to take the verdict in his absence. The jury found the said Peter not guilty as regards the articles contained in the petition.

It had been provided in the indenture, which contained the agreement as to the £100, that if the defendant paid this amount in quarterly instalments of 20 marks, beginning at Midsummer last, then the bond should be cancelled. Before that term arrived the defendant had handed over certain goods to the value of £19 17s 7d, to cover the first and part of the second instalments. They were received by the plaintiff on that understanding, as the defendant was prepared to prove. Altogether the defendant had delivered the following (fn. 15) : 3 vessels of pewter, weighing 26 lbs at 1¾d the lb; pots (olle) of pewter weighing 16 lbs at 2½d the lb; superior vessels of pewter weighing 23 lbs at 2½d the lb; 3 pewter saltcellars, value 6d; 12s 5d 2 towels, 3s; 2 towels of canvas, 2s; 2 long hand-towels (manutergiis), 4s; 2 small hand-towels, 16d; 11 savenaps and surnaps, 12d; 11s 4d one dorser, 6s 8d; one dorser, 3s 4d; 2 long bankers, 4s; dustcloths (pulvinaria), 2s; 2 bankers, 9d; old bankers and dustcloths, 12d; 17s 9d 4 bowls (pelves) and wash-bowls (lavatoria), 13s 4d; 5 brass pots and 6 posnets weighing 108 lbs at 2d the lb; brass weighing 114 lbs sold by Sibilla herself; 1 tripod and 1 cooking-pot (cacabo) 3s 4d; i iron pan (patella) for putting a fire in, 3s 4d; 58s 8d 1 coverture (coopertura) with a tester, 8s; 2 covertures, 8s; 1 mattress, 2s 6d; 1 blanket (chalon'), 6s 8d; 1 blanket, 3s 4d; 1 blankete, 16d; 1 coverture with a tester of red colour, 26s 8d; 1 coverture with a tester of bluet, 8s; 1 bed canevas and 1 bolstre 4s; 68s 6d 1 pipe of wine, 53s 4d; 2 empty pipes, 15d; meat, 22s 4d; candles, 12s; grain (grano) for dyeing cloth, 12s; (sic) £5 1s 11d Certain arrears of rent of three shops in Broad Street and five pentices on Cornhill, 27s; and £5 in cash £ 6 7s 0d Total £19 17s 7d"

Accordingly he prayed judgment as to whether the plaintiff ought to have any action against him. The plaintiff answered that he did not acknowledge the truth of any of the defendant's allegations, viz. that the goods and chattels were of the value claimed, or that he was detaining them, or that they belonged to the portion of Sibil, or that he received them in part payment of £100. On the other hand, since the defendant did not deny that the bond was his deed and that he had failed to pay at the terms mentioned in the indenture, and since the plaintiff was not bound to answer as regards the alleged detinue or the proof which the defendant claimed that he could produce, and since further the bond and the indenture contained no evidence supporting the alleged sale, and therefore the alleged sale rested merely on the word of the defendant, which he was not bound to answer—for all these reasons, the plaintiff prayed judgment. The Court wished to consult about the above pleadings and appointed a day for the giving of judgment on Wednesday after the Feast of St Peter in Cathedra [22 Feb.]. On that day the plaintiff appeared and the defendant made default. Thereupon the plaintiff, on the ground of this default, prayed judgment as to the recovery of the debt and his damages. The record and process having been read, the Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, but reserved the question of damages."

Roll A 12: 1366-67,Membr. 8,1367/03/12,"Andrew Pontadour, merchant of Lucca, brought a bill against Thomas Serlond, merchant of Lucca, complaining that whereas the said Thomas had been adjudged in legal proceedings to be debtor to the plaintiff in a certain sum of money, of which £85 15s 9d was still in arrears, the said Thomas, planning to deprive the plaintiff of his due by deceit, promised to assign to him a number of valid debts and to help him to collect them, and thus by this means he deceitfully obtained from the plaintiff a general acquittance in exchange for the following debts: £51 3s due from Sir Peter de Lacy on behalf of the Princess and other debts due from Bernard Donat of Florence, Nicholas de Mont Pissa, John Haydok, esquire, Thomas Askyn, Isabella Beauflour, Henry Forester, mercer, Sir Thomas de Gransson, Ralph Cantebrigge, Katerine Grantham, mercer, Thomas Everard, mercer, John Pycot, taverner, the executors of Richard Cherleton, Katerine Wysmar, mercer, William Morewode, Margery Ware, mercer, Adam Wymondham, mercer, Dame Agnes de Kyrkeby, mercer, Ibote Bourcere, John de Coltray, John Burstall, fourner, the Duke of Anjou (le due Dangeo), John Pecche, Master John Paladyn, the King's physician, and Henry Cove, mercer. Some of the above persons had paid the defendant, but others owed him nothing; and thus the defendant had obtained the acquittance falsely and had deceived the plaintiff to his damage £200. [French] The defendant, after one default, appeared in court and while not acknowledging the matters alleged in the plaint, pleaded that there was nothing in the bill in the nature of an action for deceit which he was bound to answer. He prayed judgment thereon. The plaintiff answered that inasmuch as the defendant, by promising to assign him valid debts, had obtained from him a general acquittance, he would be excluded from receiving what was due to him, and also from bringing an action of covenant or indeed any other action, and there would be no remedy for him unless he could have an action for deceit, and therefore he prayed judgment. After several adjournments in order that the Court might be advised, the parties appeared on Thursday after Easter week and agreed to put themselves on the arbitration of four good and lawful men, who were immediately chosen, viz. Jacopus Jacopyn and Turrellus de Gascoigne on behalf of the plaintiff, and Nicholas Maryns and Walter de Bardes on behalf of the defendant.

[French] The defendant appeared on summons and denied that he owed any money to the plaintiff as alleged, and declared himself ready to acquit himself by his law as a foreigner. Thereupon he made his law in the form in which he had waged it. Judgment was given in his favour and that the plaintiff take nothing by his bill."

Though the said John Kestevene had in fact been disallowed the £69, the said Adam Stable refused to pay the money to the plaintiff. [French] The defendant denied that he owed the plaintiff anything as alleged, and offered to acquit himself by his law as a freeman of the City, but the plaintiff refused to accept a law (as a means of proof). The Court held that the law offered was acceptable according to the custom of London (fn. 22), and gave judgment for the defendant."

William de Wodeford, mercer, brought a bill of complaint alleging that an agreement had been arrived at between himself and Richard Essex, carpenter, with regard to a debt of £22 incurred by the latter's wife, Alice, for goods supplied. The said Richard had agreed to pay £10 down, for which the plaintiff was to give him a general acquittance, on condition that he used his best endeavours with his wife to pay the rent. But if he did not urge his wife to pay and she still remained his wife, then he should be liable for the whole amount, and the acquittance should lose its force. No payment beyond the £10 had in fact been made, and the said Richard had not assisted in obtaining the residue from the said Alice, who still remained his wife; wherefore the plaintiff prayed a remedy. [French] The defendant appeared on summons and after inspecting the bond produced by the plaintiff, pleaded that the date was erased, that it was interlined and written in divers hands and that several parts of it were suspect, and he demanded judgment whether the plaintiff could found an action against him on such a document and whether he need answer to it. The plaintiff replied that the defendant had not denied that the deed was his own, and further, since it was one of a pair of indentures of which one part was sealed with the defendant's seal and the other with the plaintiff's seal, which latter indenture was in the defendant's keeping, the document could not be in any way suspect, unless some variation could be found between the two indentures, and since the defendant did not produce his own indenture, as he might have done, the plaintiff prayed judgment as to whether such an allegation against the genuineness of the document should be admitted. He prayed judgment also as regards the debt and damages. A day was given that the Court might be advised."

The lessor, however, had done neither, with the result that the complainant's guests had left the hostelry, to his loss of 20 marks. He prayed a remedy, and that the said Richard should be summoned to show cause why the complainant should not be released from his tenancy and rent. [French] The defendant admitted the covenant, which provided, he said, that if the house was not rebuilt within the first year, no further payment should be made than at the rate of 8 marks until the work should be carried out. The house was now nearly rebuilt, and the interval between the end of the first year and the present date (i.e. Michaelmas 1366 to 20 Feb. 1367) was a quarter, for which he asked only 2 marks in accordance with the agreement. He prayed judgment whether the complainant ought to have any action against him. As regards the external repairs, he was ready to verify that he had carried them out. The complainant repeated that the repairs had not been properly executed and that the defendant had broken his agreement to rebuild within a year, so that he was unable to carry on his trade of brouderie (fn. 26) or any other trade, wherefore he prayed judgment and damages. After two adjournments a jury found that the defendant had not executed the external repairs, to the complainant's damage 5 marks. Judgment was given for that amount.

Thereupon came Henry de Ware and prayed that the goods should not be valued inasmuch as they were left with him as pledges for a debt of £9 4s due to him from the defendant.

As for himself, he was willing to hand over the writing obligatory in question to whichever of them the Court should adjudge. The plaintiff Valery, while not acknowledging that the writing obligatory had been deposited under the conditions mentioned, prayed the Court to record that John de Benyngton did not produce the document in Court, nor the signed paper, nor any other deed proving the alleged conditions, and he prayed judgment on the ground that the said John de Benyngton was a foreigner, and did not produce the documents or allege any matter or cause why the Court should warn John de Southam and his partners, and moreover did not deny that he was detaining the writing obligatory. He prayed further that the deed should be delivered to him, and damages be adjudged to him. John de Benyngton also prayed judgment on the ground that the plaintiff did not deny that the document was delivered to the late Simon Benyngton under the conditions mentioned, and had alleged nothing in fact (in facto) why the said deed should be delivered to him, and he (John) then produced the deed in Court.

The defendant pleaded that he had fulfilled all the conditions of this indenture, and he prayed judgment whether the plaintiff could maintain his action against him. The plaintiff thereupon pleaded that the defendant had not fulfilled the conditions, because on 17 June, when the said Joan was on her way to consult her counsel (fn. 10), the defendant with six others lay in wait for her and assaulted her, so that she did not dare to go on, and thus the defendant had broken his agreement, as the plaintiff was prepared to verify.

The complainant further declared in his bill that there was a servant of the robbers, by name John Cook, then in Newgate, and that there were goods of the robbers in London, and he prayed that restitution might be made to him from those goods. [French] The letters patent mentioned above were to the following effect: John, Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort, informs all stewards, mayors, subordinates (seotigenz), bailiffs, and keepers of the entrances of towns and ports of his friends and allies that John de Pusor, who had sojourned and traded in the Duchy for four years past, had complained of being robbed in Brittany by men of Normandy and imprisoned outside the Duchy to his damage 500 motons dor (fn. 15), although the Duke had proclaimed in his towns and ports that all merchants might trade in the Duchy safely under his protection. Further, Bartholomew le Geneste had freighted the ship ""Notre Dame"" of Port Oriot in the Duchy, of which Colyn Herve was master, with 29 tuns of wine, of which 12 belonged to the complainant, to be unloaded at the port of Roche Derian (fn. 16). This ship had been intercepted on 23 May at the port of Blanc in the Duchy and carried into Normandy by an armed barge of St Maloo de lile, in which were Guillaume Mortfonace, Perotyn Lambert, Estive Lambert and several other burgesses of St Malo, in contempt of the Duke and to the damage of the merchants. The Duke, understanding that the said robbers had goods in divers countries, prays that, these goods may be seized and handed over to the bearer of these letters in compensation for his loss. Dated at Auray under the Duke's own seal, 14 June 1370. [French] The complainant then informed the Court that the aforesaid John Cook was servant of the said Perotyn Lambert and had divers goods of his master in London and Weymouth from which restitution could be made, and he prayed that John Cook might be summoned and examined on the premisses. John Spencer, mercer, likewise brought a bill of complaint to the effect that he had for a long time, by means of letters from the King and the Prince, been making suit to the Duke and his Council for restitution of certain goods, gold, silver and other merchandise, of which he had been robbed in the port of St Malo by men of that town on 22 May 1369, and also of 426 lampreys of Nantes, value 400 francs, of which he had been robbed by the same persons in the first week of Lent last past. The Duke had sent letters to the burgesses and Chapter (chapistre) of St Malo, who had rebelliously refused to obey him, whereupon the Duke had ordered Sir Thomas de Melbourne, Jankyn Fitz Nichol and Geffrey Stucle to inform the King and his Council that he wished them to arrest all the goods of that town, wherever they found them, until restitution had been made. On this the Chancellor had told the complainant to go and spy out such goods and, if he found them, to sue for a remedy at law. Accordingly he prayed the Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen to give him compensation on the bodies and goods of the rebellious townsmen which had been arrested in London. [French] The complainant prayed for compensation from the aforesaid John Cook. A day was given to the parties on 14 Oct., when John Cook appeared. The complainant John Pounsor then declared that a certain Perotin Boneyde and others of St Malo had taken and imprisoned him, and that Perotin Lambert on 23 May had taken from him 12 casks of wine, value 140 marks, and had done him damage to the amount of 500 floreni de motons, and further that John Cook, servant of Perotin Lambert had 500 gold florins called francs, which he delivered to John Credy, Lombard, for a bill of exchange, payable at Bruges in Flanders, and also 12 casks and one pipe of wine at Weymouth. John Spencer declared to the same effect. The defendant John Cook pleaded that he was not concerned in the allegations contained in the two bills of complaint, that he was not the servant of Perotin Lambert, nor had bought any letter of exchange, but that he was the servant of a certain Guillaume Lavocat of St Malo, whose goods he had in charge, as he was prepared to verify in any way the Court should direct."

When he was asked why he had testified falsely, he replied that every servant ought to safeguard his master's goods so far as he was able. John Credy, Lombard, then produced 460 florins, which were deposited in court. As the Court desired information as to whether this money belonged to the King or ought to be handed over to the complainants, an adjournment for a week was ordered, and the latter were advised to sue the matter in the King's Council. It should be noted that Thomas de Melbourne, Treasurer of the Duke of Brittany, and John Fitz Nichol, Admiral of Brittany, told the Recorder that the complainants were robbed by men of St Malo, and that the Duke wanted them to be compensated from the goods of the offenders, but that the whole town was not hostile to the King; on the other hand, Geoffrey Stucle said that the whole town was hostile. Afterwards on 3 Dec., on a command of the King delivered by the Chancellor by word of mouth, the Court handed over the prisoner, John Cook, and the 460 florins to the two complainants."

Dated at Westminster, 27 June Ao 47 Edw. III [1373]. Return giving the proceedings in the above action up to date, as entered in the Husting Roll (No. xciv) among the Pleas of Land of Monday before the Feast of St Barnabas the Apostle [11 June] Ao 46 Edw. III [1372]. [The Husting Roll contains the whole action, which was begun by a writ of Right Patent dated 16 Jan. Ao 43 Edw. III [1369-70]. After the usual series of summonses and essoins the plaintiff, John Everard, on Monday after the Feast of the Translation of St Edward King [13 Oct.] Ao 44 Edw. III [1370] by Gilbert de Meldebourne, his attorney, demanded a messuage and 40s annual rent, formerly belonging to a certain Sarra Amys. On her dying without issue the property had fallen in (resortebatur) to a certain William, maternal uncle of her father John, of which William the plaintiff was son and heir. The defendant Margaret by her attorney Robert de Watlyngton pleaded that she held the messuage and rent for life by letters patent granted to her late husband, the reversion belonging to the King. She demanded the King's aid. Thereupon the plaintiff was directed to sue against the King. Subsequently the plaintiff produced a writ of procedendo, dated 26 April Ao 46 Edw. III [1372] setting forth that Margaret had been summoned before the King in Chancery to show cause etc., and by her attorney Hugh de Gaudeby had given no reason why the action should not proceed, wherefore the Court was ordered to continue the action but not to give judgment before consulting the King. In further proceedings the defendant produced a copy of a grant by the King of the reversion of the above property, which was situated in the Riole (fn. 37), to Robert de Corby, the deed mentioning that the King had previously granted it for life to John de la Touke, butler of the late Queen Isabella, and Margaret his wife. This document was dated 20 Jan. Ao 38 Edw. III [1364-5]. She said further that Robert de Corby was dead and that the reversion descended to his son Robert, whom she vouched to warranty. As regards the 40s annual rent, she said that as a result of an inquest held before John Pecche, then Mayor and Escheator, on the death of Sarra Amys, the rent had escheated to the King, as she was prepared to verify by a jury. The plaintiff prayed judgment as to whether she ought to be allowed to call to warranty, since she had already invoked the aid of the King. A warranty, he pleaded, would not establish the King's title but merely depended on it. The defendant pleaded that she had a right to call to warranty in order to exonerate the King, even though she had previously invoked the King's aid. The case was adjourned for consultation on this point. As regards the 40s rent both parties were agreed to submit the matter to a jury."
Roll A 18: 1372-73,Membr. 10 b,1373/06/27,"Subsequently Robert Corby appeared and prayed to be admitted to defend his right in the reversion, on the ground that the defendant Margaret had only a life interest, and was pleading fictitiously (ficte) in order to lose the aforesaid messuage, to the disinheriting of the applicant. Thereupon the parties were asked to show cause why the intervener should not defend his right, and offered no objection. He was accordingly admitted, and demanded the aid of the King. The Court ordered the plaintiff again to sue against the King. Process was continued until Monday after the Feast of St Hilary [13 Jan.] Ao 46 Edw. III [1372-3], when, as regards the annual rent of 40s, a jury found that the plaintiff was the heir of the above-mentioned Sarra Amys. Judgment was respited till the King's writ of procedendo should be received. Finally on Monday after the Feast of St Hilary [13 Jan.] Ao 49 Edw. III [1375-6] a writ of procedendo was received to the effect that as the defendant Margaret, the King's Serjeants and his Attorney, Michael Skillyng, had offered no objection, the Husting should proceed to judgment as regards the 40s rent, but as regards the messuage no plea should be held without consulting the King. Judgment was thereupon given for the plaintiff for the rent.]"

The Court fixed a day in order to have further information, the children in the meantime being placed in the custody of the Mayor. As the result of their investigations, the Court discovered that the late Richard de Sutton was not a freeman and had died outside the liberties of the City, and that the children were born outside the liberties, and accordingly they decided that they had no concern with the guardianship. At this juncture, the parties announced that they had come to an agreement, whereby the executors should have the guardianship of the said Elmyng and Margaret, and that they should receive the two legacies of £50 bequeathed to each child, together with 40 marks bequeathed to each of two other children, Richard and Alice, and £20 to another child, Joan.

They proffered the deed of feoffment which was dated 21 June 1374. The plaintiff replied that the defendant, before the levying of the plaint, had fled to Westminster in order to exclude him from his action, and at the time the plaint was levied he was seised of the tenements, and that the interveners had no interest in the property except at the will of the defendant, nor did they derive any profit therefrom except for the use of the defendant, whereof he prayed verification etc. The said Thomas, Ralph and Simon pleaded that they were enfeoffed simply for their own use and benefit for ever, and prayed that it might be inquired of by a jury.

The said John had received payment of these debts before the foreign attachment was made. Accordingly the plaintiff demanded judgment whether in the face of these facts he could be admitted to proof. To this the said John replied that he did not acknowledge having received the money or having made any admission as alleged, and he pleaded that by the custom of the City he could not be excluded from proof. After three adjournments that the Court might consider its judgment, the said John failed to put in an appearance, whereupon judgment was given that the plaintiff should have the foreign attachment of £50 under the usual security to answer therefor if etc., and that if the said John had nothing from which the £50 could be levied, he should be taken and imprisoned until the money was forthcoming."

As regards the allegation that the debtor was allowed to go at large for default of enrolment, he pleaded that, while the action was still pending and no judgment had been given, the plea was adjourned sine die because the debtor produced a writ of protection from the King, as appears by the record produced in court. He demanded judgment as to whether the plaintiff had any action against him. The plaintiff replied that the debtor had acknowledged the obligation six weeks and more before the letters of protection. The making of a law was not permissible in an action of deceit which affected the King as well as the party plaintiff. As regards his other allegation (concerning the acknowledgment), the defendant had not denied it, arid accordingly he demanded judgment and damages. Process being continued between the parties until Tuesday before the Feast of St Luke the Evangelist [18 Oct.] Ao 4 Ric. II [1380], the proceedings were recited in full Husting before the Mayor and Aldermen. As it appeared to the Court that a law was permissible by the custom of the City in such a case, as evidenced by previous judgments, and as the plaintiff refused to accept the plaintiff's law, judgment was given that as regards that part of the bill of complaint, the plaintiff should take nothing. Afterwards on 2 Oct. Ao 5 Ric. II [1381] the plaintiff quitclaimed all actions against the defendant."

The defendant having denied that he was receiver, this issue was left to a jury, which found for the plaintiff. Thereupon the Court assigned John Phelipot, Robert Warbulton, Adam de St Ives and William Cressewyk as auditors to hear the account. On Saturday before the Feast of St Edmund King [20 Nov.] the auditors brought in a sealed report that the parties had not come to an agreement and that the only evidence offered by the defendant to clear himself of the debt was a writing obligatory made to him and a certain Geoffrey Scut by a certain Thomas Clerk. Both parties having appeared before the Mayor and Aldermen, the plaintiff prayed judgment As the report contained no mention of the value of the woolfells, the action was remitted to the auditors, who subsequently reported that both parties agreed that the value was £60, that being the sum for which they had been sold. They added further that the above-mentioned writing obligatory was for the sum of £120 and related to the purchase of the woolfells by Thomas Clerk. As it seemed clear to the Court that the action concerned the law merchant (fn. 2) and should be terminated according to the same by the custom of the City, the Mayor, after informing the parties that he was Mayor of the Staple of Westminster as well as Mayor of the City of London, and that the law merchant was pleadable before him both in the Staple and the Chamber of the Guildhall, asked them if they were willing to have judgment by the law merchant. Both parties consented. The Mayor then asked the defendant if he had anything to say against making satisfaction to the plaintiff for the woolfells. The defendant said nothing except that the plaintiff ordered him to deliver the woolfells to Thomas Clerk, tapicer, and to take from him a writing obligatory made out to the defendant and Geoffrey Scut. This the plaintiff denied outright. He was then sworn according to the law merchant and repeated his denial on oath, saying that he had told the defendant expressly that he must answer either for the woolfells or for £60. Judgment was given by the law merchant that the plaintiff recover that sum. The Court then handed over to the defendant the above-mentioned writing obligatory and its defeasance and the defendant was committed to prison quousque. The said Geoffrey Scut, who had been committed to prison at the suit of John Pope and afterwards bailed by Thomas Clench and John Campyon, was likewise committed to prison.

The defendants pleaded that the matter had already been submitted to the arbitration of John Lucas, Thomas Kyrwode, William Valdrian and John Haryngeye, four masters of the Saddlers, together with six other men of that mistery, the final award to be given by an umpire, if they were unable to agree. The arbitrators had agreed that the servant was only engaged by the week at a wage of 20d and his keep, but not knowing whether he left before a week was ended, they had left that question for the umpire to settle. The defendants prayed judgment as to whether the plaintiff had any action against them. The plaintiff admitted the arbitration, but said that the arbitrators were not agreed and left it to the umpire to bring the matter to a conclusion, and that the latter refused to do so, telling the parties to go to law. He put himself on the evidence of the ten saddlers, and the defendants did likewise. The ten saddlers, on being summoned, swore that they were fully agreed that the servant's contract was by the week and not for a year. The Court thereupon gave judgment that the plaintiff take nothing by either of his bills, and be in mercy."

Both parties appeared and, as it seemed to them that the plaint concerned the law merchant and ought to be terminated by that law, they prayed that William Walworth, who was Mayor of the City of London and at the same time Mayor of the Staple of Westminster, and so was competent to administer the law merchant (fn. 7), should take the action before him and bring an end to it, and they willingly agreed to abide by his judgment. The Mayor accepted, and in order that he might be more fully informed as to the full truth of the matter, the parties chose Galdinus Rest, James Fane, Peter Peateys, Peter Rodolf, Gulstan Pynnel and John Sturtilion, Lombards, to see and examine the papers and other evidences and, together with the Mayor, to hear and examine the parties on all circumstances relating to the matter, so that the Mayor might be able to render a better and juster judgment according to the law merchant. To the same end the six Lombards were sworn. Since it appeared after examination that the aforesaid cloth came into the defendant's hands in the manner alleged by the plaintiff, that the defendant sold them to a certain John Deinterminellis and his partners for 234 livres gross of Flanders, that the defendant was not a partner of John Deinterminellis, and that he promised the plaintiff that the said John would give the plaintiff sufficient security for the money, which he had failed to do, judgment was given by the Mayor that the defendant should obtain from the said John sufficient security before midsummer next, failing which, or in case of the said John's death, he should himself pay the money due. As he was unable to find security for carrying out the judgment he was committed to prison till he did so.

[25 March] in St Bartholomew's Church, Smithfield, and for nine years before that in the garden called ""Hyginesgardyn,"" made a covin and confederacy to the damage of the common weal (res publica) and ordained that none of them should make a quartern (fn. 14) of spurs for less than 20d nor take less than 2s for the polishing of the same under penalty of perjury. That because John Bonere, spurrier, was unwilling to keep this ordinance they caused him to be summoned to the Consistory Court of the Bishop of London for perjury. That the said Nicholas etc. ordained that there should be a meeting every month in the said church or other place assigned by the captains of their company for the making of new ordinances, and that any person failing to appear should pay to the fraternity for each absence a pound of wax. That a certain Richard Pollard so failing to appear was summoned to the Consistory Court for perjury. That the said Nicholas etc. set up a common box, of which John Swyneshed had custody, the keys being kept by the said Nicholas, into which box each person of the fraternity was to put ½d a week, whereby the fraternity had collected 18 marks 12s, besides other pledges, for the maintenance of their ordinances. That the said Nicholas etc. ordained that only journeymen (servientes) should belong to their society, but no person keeping house, unless he had been sworn while he was still a journeyman. That the said Nicholas etc. ordained that if a master keeping house within the City receive to work any foreigner, all the journeymen of their society should leave his service until he had dismissed the foreigner; and further that if any of them heard any evil word spoken of any of their fellows in their absence they should inform the society thereof. That the said Nicholas etc. had a public instrument made under the seal of a notary, in which, it was suspected, unsatisfactory (inutiles) ordinances were written. By virtue of the above indictment, William Wircestre, serjeant of the Chamber, was ordered to take the indicted persons and bring them before the Mayor and Aldermen on 15 April to answer to the King and the Commonalty of the City on the said articles. On that day Nicholas Symond and John Swyneshed were reported as being in the hands of the Sheriffs, but the other persons could not be found. On 25 May the said Nicholas pleaded not guilty and put himself on the country, while the said John pleaded not guilty only to certain articles, admitting the charges concerning the citation of John Bonere and Richard Pollard, the monthly meeting and the common box. He further admitted that he had taken part in a congregation in Easter week, though he and the rest had been forbidden to do so by the Mayor on 9 April. On 29 May a jury found him guilty of the other four articles of the indictment, and the said Nicholas now pleaded guilty of all charges. They were mainprised to come up for judgment. Afterwards, on 24 Sept. all the indicted persons appeared before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber of the Guildhall in the presence of the masters of the said mistery, viz. Roger Payn, Roger Mortymer, William Harecourt, John de Dene, William Ketil, John Frenssh, Ralph Node, Gilbert Piriman, William Dybelyn, Richard in the lane, Thomas Kene, Thomas Frenssh, John Brackele, Thomas Reve, John More and John Boner, who were summoned by the Mayor. They put themselves on the mercy of the Court. Thereupon they were sworn severally that they would not keep any of the articles mentioned in the indictment, make suits or divisions among themselves, bind anyone by an oath under colour of their said fraternity, make or engage in any separate covins, or attempt anything whereby the peace of the mistery or the common good of the City should be prejudiced, but that they would be obedient both to the ministers of the City and the overseers of the mistery for the time being in all things relating to their craft, under penalty of £100, by way of recognizance, payable to the Chamberlain for the use of the City. As regards the charges admitted by them, the Court, at the request of the good men of the mistery, remitted fines and imprisonment, warning them that any future offence would be punished by loss of the freedom, and by the pillory—the proper penalty for breach of an oath. An agreement was then made between John More and John Boner, prosecuting on behalf of the good men of the mistery, and the defendants, that the articles in the indictment should be annulled. Next day Thomas Nichol, William Brente, Richard Large, Richard Wych, Richard Shrympelyng, Thomas Haye, Simon Bosegate, John Reynold, John Pountfret, Richard Pollard and Richard Smyth, who were also members of the fraternity but had not been indicted, were likewise charged. They admitted their offence and were bound over in the same terms as their fellows, an agreement being made between them and the prosecutors. The Court directed that the goods and chattels held in common by the fraternity, which had been arrested, should be distributed by them, with the exception of the common box, to the poorer members of the fraternity, according to their discretion and good conscience."

Roll A 24: 1380-81,Membr. 11,1381/03/24,"Thomas Strouston, mercer, sued John More, mercer, for the sum of £180 due under a bond. The defendant pleaded that the bond was defeasible on payment of £90 by instalments and that only £55 were due, which he now deposited in court. He further stated that he was bound on behalf of Norman Swynford, knight, who owed money to the aforesaid Thomas and had appointed the same Thomas to pay his other creditors. As it was not clear to the defendant how much was still owing to the plaintiff himself, he asked that the latter should be examined on oath. Thereupon the plaintiff declared on oath that of the £55 due, the sum of £27 was owing to himself. Thereupon that amount was paid to him and the bond was cancelled. Afterwards, on the same day came Nicholas Roune, clerk, attorney of William de Wyndesore, knight, and declared that the said Norman owed his master a large sum of money and asked that the sum of £28 (the residue of the £55 above mentioned) might be arrested at the suit of his master. Accordingly the money was put in arrest till 2 Oct. when there came before the Mayor Simon de Burgh, who asked that the money might be given to him, inasmuch as the said Norman had, at the time of his death abroad, made a gift to him of all his goods and chattels, and had previously written to the aforesaid Thomas authorizing him to pay the bearer of the letter the sum of £90, of which the aforesaid sum of £28 formed a part.

Roll A 24: 1380-81,Membr. 12,1381/09/19,"Thomas Cherleton and John Hervy, junior, brought a bill complaining that John Phelipot, knight, refused to pay them the sum of 2000 francs, each franc being worth 3s 2d, which sum had been entrusted to him by the hands of Peter Merk, Gerard Beek and Nichol Luke, Lombards, attorneys of Oliver Claykyn (fn. 26), on 7 Sept. for delivery to the plaintiffs. [French] The said John, who was present in court, said that the money had been entrusted to him under the conditions of a document [French] which stated that Reymund de Spars and Martin Seyns, who were keepers of a certain prisoner called Oliver Claykyn and joint owners of a portion of his ransom called ""les Marz"" had by their proctor, Master Pascal, sold the ""Marz"" to Thomas Cherleton and John Hervy and that the executors of John Darundell had claimed the money, whereupon it was agreed that it should be placed in his hands until the law of London adjudged to whom it belonged. Thereupon came John Mautravers, Robert Rous, knight, Laurence Seybrok, John Frome, Sir John Chelrey, Sir Robert Skarclyf and William Ryvere, executors of Sir John Darundell, by Richard Forster, their attorney, and said that they were parties to the above agreement, and asked leave to interplead directly with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs consented and by John Juel, their attorney, declared that the money belonged to them, because after certain disputes and claims to the ransom of the prisoner it had been agreed that the King of Navarre should have the third part of the ransom, Sir John Darundell the third part of the residue, Amcot de Solle and Johanco Dartaisso, masters of the prisoner, the remainder, and Reymund Despars and Martin Seyns, who had borne the cost of keeping the prisoner, should receive from him, as ""les Marz"" at the rate of 5 francs for every 20 francs he paid as ransom. The prisoner was put to ransom by his masters for 40,000 gold francs with the consent of Reymund and Martin. Afterwards the latter took loans of silver and other goods from the plaintiffs, for which Master Pascal, Amcot and Johanco were sureties, and in order to pay the plaintiffs they gave Master Pascal a power of attorney to sell their rights called ""les Marz"" to them. The prisoner was then put in their keeping, and it was agreed that there should be no diminution of the ransom demanded and that the prisoner should not be removed from the tower of Ludgate without their consent. Following on that the plaintiffs had spent about £20 for the prisoner's keep. Afterwards, because of the sudden arrival of divers commons who had broken into insurrection, the masters and joint-owners of the prisoner, being afraid that he might be killed and being anxious to set him at liberty, reduced the ransom demanded to 25,000 francs. The 2000 francs above mentioned were put into the hands of John Phelipot as being a portion of the ""Marz."" The plaintiffs now demanded delivery of this money and damages against the executors. The defendant John Mautravers, appearing personally, and the other defendants by their attorney, pleaded that as executors they had sued the said Reymund and Martin for sums of 750 marks and 200 marks due on bonds, and by the custom of the City the 2000 francs in the hands of John Phelipot had been attached as a foreign attachment as being the moneys of the said Reymund and Martin. The prisoner, they said, belonged to the King of Navarre, Amcot and Johanco, and the executors, and the fifth part, called ""les Marz,"" to Reymund and Martin for their expenses. By the law of arms, the masters of the prisoner had the right to put him to ransom without the consent of those to whom the fifth part belonged, the latter having no right of interference. Further, by the law of arms, if a prisoner were put to ransom by his masters and did not observe the day of payment, his masters could put him to ransom afresh either at a less or greater sum. The prisoner, who should have paid 40,000 francs in equal portions at the Feast of the Purification and Easter, had failed to pay, and the ransom had then been fixed at 25,000 francs. The appointment of Master Pascal as proxy and his sale of ""les Marz"" to the plaintiffs had taken place before the new ransom was fixed. Further, by the law of arms, no joint-owner of a prisoner was entitled to put the prisoner in anyone else's keeping without the consent of his coparceners, and this consent had not been given. Thus the 2000 francs could not legally be sold to anyone, and the plaintiffs had no right or title in that sum. They prayed judgment as to whether the plaintiffs ought to have delivery of the money."
Roll A 24: 1380-81,Membr. 12b,1381/09/19,"The plaintiffs answered that the said Amcot and Johanco were sole masters of the prisoner and that the King of Navarre and Sir John Darundell had no claim to him or his ransom, beyond a third part. As regards the plea that a new ransom of 25,000 francs had been fixed, they answered that it was merely a diminution of the old ransom, which diminution was due to the insurrection and was approved by themselves. In view of the fact that the executors did not deny the sale of ""les Marz"" or the authority of Master Pascal to sell them, or the assent of Amcot and Johanco to the sale, or that the prisoner was bound over to pay ""les Marz"" to the purchasers, or that the prisoner was acquitted of all payments to Reymund and Martin, and in view of the fact that both the executors and the plaintiffs were bound to fulfil the conditions alleged by John Phelipot, they claimed judgment and delivery of the money. As regards the law of arms they did not acknowledge that the law was as alleged or that they need answer to the allegation. [Breaks off.]"

The defendant, while protesting (fn. 33) that he did not acknowledge either the quantity or the value of the cloth, pleaded that Isabella, wife of the plaintiff, was a common maker of woollen cloth (fn. 34), and that she delivered the said cloths to the said Simon to be fulled and after they were fulled she ordered him to take them to the defendant, which he did. He pleaded further that by the custom of the city (fn. 35) contracts made by married women engaged in a mercantile art were as effectual as contracts made by their husbands, that Isabella had always used the art of making woollen cloths and sold the same as a feme sole, and that on 20 May 1374 she came to his house in Lothbury and told him that she had sold the cloth to William Sutton and others for 102 marks, and he was to deliver the cloth to the said William, taking a bond from the said William, Geoffrey Sutton, William Chaloner and Thomas de Angyr, cordwainer, in the sum of 204 marks as security for the payment of the aforesaid 102 marks, and this was done because he was an officer of the city and better able to enforce payment than either Isabella or her husband.

Since the defendant did not deny receiving the cloth, he prayed judgment and that auditors of an account be appointed. Afterwards, on 17 July, the plaintiff, on being called, failed to appear.

Thereupon, on Monday before Christmas 1371, the defendant was paid £28, but he afterwards sold the ground, while retaining the £28, thus deceiving the plaintiff and causing him damage to the"" extent of £40. The defendant appeared and prayed leave to imparl (fn. 39) till Monday the 12th, which was granted to him peremptorily. On that day he did not come but left the court.

The prioress by her attorney, Gilbert Meldebourne, pleaded that her predecessor Elianora had nothing in demesne or in reversion in the above-mentioned tenements except an annual quitrent of 40s which had always belonged to the convent, that the tenants after the supposed grant had not attorned (fn. 42) to John de Shene, and further that the annual payment was only a pension chargeable on the person of the late prioress and was not by law chargeable on the person of the present prioress. She prayed judgment. The executors pleaded that the grant by Elianora had been made by consent of the convent and that the defendant had not denied that John, Alice, Richard and Cecilia had afterwards successively had seisin of the rent, and they prayed judgment thereon. A day was given that the court might be advised as to their judgment, when the prioress made default, and though order was given to distrain her for a further day to hear judgment, she again made default. Therefore it was considered that the executors recover the arrears and that the prioress be in mercy."
Calendar - Roll A 25: 1381-83,Membr. 11 b,1382/11/08,"Henry Cauntebrigge brought a bill before the Mayor and Aldermen to the following effect: In the year 1364 he had borrowed, by way of chevisance (fn. 43), from Geoffrey Puppe and William Brampton a quantity of merchandise, viz. stockfish called ""gricoks,"" saltfish, tables (fn. 44), pitch and tar amounting to £26, the loan being effected by a broker. As security he had given a bond for a sum of money and an annuity of £10 for eight years on property in the parish of St Christopher on Cornhill, and furthermore he had entered into a recognisance of £88 12s 8d in the Chancery. It was agreed that for every year the creditors held the above property they should allow a rebate of £10 on the debt. They had actually held the property for four and a half years, when the plaintiff repaid the debt of £26 and a further sum of 20 marks. But the creditors would only allow him a rebate of 10 marks (£6 13s 4d) each year for the four and a half years, so that in addition to the repayment of their debt, they obtained from him £15 (the difference between the £10 and 10 marks per annum) and the above-mentioned 20 marks (£13 6s 8d), making £28 6s 8d. The creditors had given him back his deeds but had not cancelled the recognisance in Chancery, which he was afraid might cause loss to himself or his executors. [French] The defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had given them an acquittance on condition that the recognisance should be withdrawn and they had in fact immediately afterwards withdrawn it. Thereupon the mayor took the parties into the Inner Chamber of Guildhall, where the defendants agreed to return the recognisance to the plaintiff and give him an acquittance."

He made four defaults and it was reported to the court that he had fled to the priory of St Mary Southwark outside the liberty of the city and that he had no goods and chattels in the city, but only tenements and rents in the parishes of All Hallows Graschirchestret and St Margaret Patyns. The plaintiff prayed that these might be assigned to him by way of foreign attachment until his claims were satisfied, in accordance with the custom of the city observed in the like case from of old. The court consented and after summoning the tenants inquired from them what rents were in arrear and warned them not to pay any moneys to the defendant until the plaintiff had been fully satisfied. One of the tenants, Robert Broud, who was rented at 14 marks, informed the court that the defendant had undertaken to keep the tenement in repair against wind and rain and until this was done he could make no profit from, it. The court then ordered a report from the sworn masons and carpenters of the city (fn. 45), who certified that the necessary repairs could be made for 40s, which the plaintiff was told to charge against the arrears due from that tenement. But the tenant refused to pay the workmen more than 2 marks or to pay the plaintiff anything, contrary to the order of the court. He was committed to prison till he should pay and find security for future payments of rent."

After process continued, the defendant appeared on 8 July and admitted the debt. He informed the court that he had sued a certain Peter Gracian to render account of business dealings between them, including the matter of the wool, on which the present claim was being made. He was willing, if the auditors found that he had not paid to Peter the abovementioned sums of money, that he would himself pay them immediately to Nicholas Brembre, knight and merchant, to whom they had been assigned by the plaintiffs in satisfaction for debts owed by them to Nicholas. But even if it were found that he had paid the money to Peter, he was willing to satisfy the said Nicholas, on condition that he received acquittances for the bonds and was not troubled as regards any other debts of Peter, and on condition that the latter remained in prison until he (Peter) had reimbursed him. Thereupon the court appointed Walter Silyle and John Shadeworth, Englishmen, and Gulstan Pynel or Gerard Bek and Gautron de Bardes, Lombards, as auditors, who on 19 Aug. produced the account. They found that Luke owed Peter £91 12s 8d, and that Peter ought to perform the following matters, viz. deliver to Luke a barrel of Inde Bakade (fn. 46), pay him 103s on behalf of John Swyft, mercer, deliver two sarplers (fn. 47) of wool, which he had arrested at Calais, or £40, pay £161 5s due from certain Brabantine merchants for the wool of William Grevel, deliver a quantity of goods belonging to Matthew Dony which he had pledged with the company of Arige (fn. 48) of Bologna for £150 gros (fn. 49), give him a fourth part of the profits on 73 sarplers of wool on a bargain made with William Grevel, account for the sum of £26 19s paid as costs to Henry Pensehurst on the wool, and withdraw an action for £1800 which he had brought against Luke in the Sheriffs' Court. [French] On this the court committed Luke to prison for his debt of £91 12s 8d and ordered that Peter be confined in fetters in the Bocardo (fn. 50) of Newgate till he had satisfied Luke on his claims. The latter then, in accordance with his undertaking, agreed to pay Nicholas Brembre the sum of £908 4s claimed and a further sum of £341 16s, and he and Peter were committed to prison. Finally on 2 July 1385, Nicholas Brembre, who was then mayor, appeared in court with Luke and Peter, who were both at large, and announced that they had come to an agreement. All parties prayed that each might be exonerated against the others. And thus the court was quit of the matter."

Calendar - Roll A 25: 1381-83,Membr. 18,1383/02/10,"John Jewell, attorney of Thomas Gisors, merchant, made a complaint as follows: On 27 Nov. 1381 a certain John Colshull, late servant and attorney of Thomas Gisors, brought an action for debt against his late master in the Sheriffs' Court before John Hende, sheriff, claiming from him three several sums of £105, £165 and £110 8s 8d, and the said Thomas having made default, his lands, tenements and rents in the city were delivered to the plaintiff as a foreign attachment until his claims should be satisfied, unless the said Thomas should submit himself to justice within a year and a day. Afterwards the said Thomas appeared before John Sely, sheriff, and prayed that John Colshull be summoned to appear on 5 Nov. 1382 to show cause why the lands and tenements should not be restored to him, since he was now ready to submit himself to justice and to prove that he owed nothing. Nevertheless, the plea had for a long time been left pending, neither discussed nor terminated, because the sheriff favoured John Colshull; for which reason, and because the matter concerned the law merchant, the attorney now prayed the Mayor and Aldermen to cause the record and process of the action to come before them, in order that they might make an end of the matter. The Mayor and Aldermen granted the request and ordered the parties to appear and the sheriff to bring the record and process on 27 Feb. 1383, on which day the sheriff brought the record and process of the proceedings held before John Hende, sheriff, on 27 Nov. 1381, and before John Sely, sheriff, on 5 Nov. 1382 [as summarised above in the attorney's complaint]. Thereupon John Jewell, on. behalf of Thomas Gisors, prayed that John Colshull make his declaration against the said John Jewell."
Calendar - Roll A 25: 1381-83,Membr. 18 b,1383/02/10,"The said John Colshull, after citing a power of attorney of 24 Aug. 1372, whereby his master empowered him to receive debts, give acquittances, trade with his goods and enter into bonds for payments, declared that afterwards his master wrote to him at Bruges, asking him to pay 1000 crowns (fn. 52), at the rate of £105 sterling, to a creditor named John van Putten, Esterlyng, which payment the plaintiff made out of his own money, and so, by the law merchant, an action accrued to him to demand that amount from his master in reimbursement. As regards the sum of £165 claimed, he declared that he made an exchange with William Ancroft, attorney of Adam Fraunceys of London, of 1500 crowns, at the rate of £165 sterling, for his master's use, and therewith he paid divers sums to his master's creditors, viz. £100 Flemish gros (fn. 53) to John Fermer and £49 17s 6d Flemish gros to John van Assen, making a total of 1500 crowns (fn. 54). In order to raise this money he had entered into a personal bond to the said William Ancroft and a certain John Ussher, and he had subsequently redeemed his bond by paying the amount due out of his own moneys. And as regards the sum of £no 8s 8d, he declared that he had made another exchange with William Ancroft of 1000 crowns, at the rate of £110 8s 8d sterling, and had paid that sum to a creditor of his master, Peter Arnauld of Vines, Gascon (fn. 55), and that he had afterwards redeemed his bond out of his own moneys. The said Thomas Gisors, while not acknowledging the above allegations, pleaded that the plaintiff, at the time when he alleged these payments to have been made, was under obligation to render account to his master for certain sums of money, as set forth in a roll produced in court; and by the custom of the city and the law merchant, if any servant or agent made payments on behalf of his master, he had no right of action against him for reimbursement, so long as he had in his hands moneys of his master sufficient to cover those payments, which moneys the plaintiff at that time had. Wherefore he prayed restitution of his lands and tenements. The plaintiff, in reply, produced a quitclaim, dated 6 July 1373, whereby the defendant had released him, under the name of ""John Colshull, late apprentice of Thomas Gisors,"" of all claims, debts, accounts and trespasses, subsequent to which he had received no moneys from his master save a free gift of £10. The defendant prayed judgment on the ground that the plaintiff had not denied having received the moneys set forth in the roll produced, while the plaintiff likewise prayed judgment because his quitclaim freed him from the necessity of answering to the roll. After process continued, on 23 Oct. 1383 it was considered by the court that John Colshull recover his debts, and that the execution of the judgment in the Sheriffs' Court stand, in accordance with the custom of the city and the law merchant."

The defendant pleaded that the only debt he owed was one of £22 10s due on a bond, and he was willing to make his law that he owed no other debt (fn. 9), and as the plaintiff had not produced any bond for the £22 10s, he prayed judgment as to whether any action lay against him.

The defendant pleaded that a certain John Bethewode, tymbermonger and citizen, had sued the plaintiff for a debt of £36 before the justices of the Bench at Westminster in Michaelmas term 1378, as the result of which the plaintiff had been put in exigent and outlawed, and that therefore the present action, being a personal action and originating from a time long before the outlawry, was extinguished. To this the plaintiff replied that the king by a charter, which he produced, had pardoned him the outlawry, that he had made suit by scire facias against the aforesaid party according to the form of the statute (fn. 10) upon which his pardon was allowed to him, and that inasmuch as the defendant did not deny his allegations he prayed judgment and damages.

As the money had been lying for a long time in the Sheriffs' Court without any discussion or judgment, the said Robert Kydenot prayed the mayor to summon the action into the Chamber of the Guildhall and there deal with it according to the law merchant. Accordingly the mayor gave the parties a day on 12 May 1383, when Richard Horewode gave evidence on oath as to purchasing the linen, but said he did not know whether it belonged to Robert Kydenot or Robert Colyn. Thereupon Robert Kydenot asked for and obtained fifteen days adjournment in order that Robert Colyn, who was in Calais, might be examined in the presence of the mayor of the Staple of Calais or his lieutenant and constables. After that interval he produced in court a certificate [French] dated 14 April 1383 from the lieutenant and constables of Calais, to the effect that Robert Colyn had appeared before them and had informed them that the linen belonged to himself alone and that he had assigned the money due for it to Robert Kydenot because he was indebted to him in a larger sum of money, and that he owed nothing to Henry Permay. This document having been read by the court, it was considered that the £4 should be delivered to Robert Kydenot under security that, if the said Henry Permay or Robert Colyn should appear within a year and a day and prove reasonably that it belonged to them or either of them, the said Robert should repay it."

Roll A 26: 1382-83,Membr. 6,1383/07/24,"William Brikles, pepperer, executor of the will of Sabina Yerdele (fn. 15), brought a bill of complaint before the Mayor and Aldermen showing that the said Sabina six years before her death had set apart and specified in her will a sum of £100 for the support of a chaplain to celebrate divine service in the church of All Hallows the Great for her wellbeing in life and for her soul after death, the said chaplain to receive an annual salary of 10 marks. She had appointed Walter Lyndon as chaplain and had placed the money in the hands of Robert Corn on account of the trust and affection she felt for him. The said Robert had paid the chaplain £40 for the six years before her death and 33s 4d for the first quarter of the year afterwards. But though the chaplain had celebrated for three further years, the said Robert would neither pay him the £20 thus due nor appoint another chaplain. The said Robert appeared on summons on 27 July and said that Sabina at the time of her death had acquitted him of all that remained of the £100, i.e. £60, and that he had paid 33s 4d more to the chaplain of his own free will, and that therefore he need not answer further, nor pay more to the chaplain, nor appoint another one. The plaintiff answered that so far as his own knowledge went Sabina had never acquitted him. Thereupon the defendant offered to pay the £20 in arrears of the chaplain's salary, if the plaintiff together with two other good men would swear that he had no knowledge that Sabina had remitted the £60 (fn. 16). The plaintiff accepted this offer and produced four men, viz. Roger Carneford, Henry Baret, John Romeseye and William Campyon, who, after he had taken the oath, swore that his oath, so far as they knew, was a true one. Accordingly it was considered that the defendant pay the £20 in arrears to the chaplain, and as the latter had received no notice about seeking other work, that the defendant pay him 10 marks for the coming year. And since the will produced in court showed that the testator wished the defendant to be exonerated from finding a chaplain if he fell into poverty through misfortune or any other cause, the question of continuing the chaplain's services was respited until the court should have information as to the defendant's means. The defendant then paid £20 arrears of salary and afterwards on 30 Nov. the instalment of the present year's salary due at Michaelmas."

Gilbert Meldebourne, the plaintiff's attorney, declared the amount as £19, i.e. £15 (fn. 21) for bread, beer, meat, fish and other victuals bought by Matilda, the defendant's wife, for herself and her two servants when she was in the hospital, to wit, 18s thereof for two loaves, two gallons of beer and two dishes of cookery every day from 11 July to 22 Aug. 1378, in the time of John Lyndeseye then prior; 66s 8d which she borrowed from the prior through Robert Salisbury, canon of the hospital, on 20 July 1376; £8 6s 8d for other victuals supplied to her for 50 weeks from 22 Aug. 1378 at 40d a week in the time of Robert Salisbury, who was sub-prior during the vacancy; £7 for other victuals during the time of the present prior from 5 Aug. 1379 for 42 weeks at 40d a week; and 6s 8d borrowed from the prior on 15 June 1381 through Thomas Tomme, chaplain; all of which sums the defendant refused to pay, to the plaintiff's damage £20. The defendant denied the debt, excepting the loan of £3 6s 8d, and put himself on the country. As regards the loan he said that his wife gave as security a locked and sealed forcer containing goods of the same value, which forcer still remained in the prior's hands. Thereupon the prior's attorney was ordered to bring the forcer to court on 28 July. Process was continued till 8 Oct., when the attorney brought into court one large and six small buttons, made of silver pennies, together with the forcer. In the absence of the said Matilda, who had the key, the forcer was opened and found to contain nothing of any value. It was sealed again with the seal of John Charneye, coroner of London, and returned to the prior. The defendant's attorney then produced a writ of protection in favour of the defendant, running from 29 Aug. for one year, and prayed that the action might be adjourned without a day. The court allowed the protection as regards the two debts for money borrowed. But, since by the custom of the city a protection was not valid in a plea concerning victuals, a jury was chosen, tried and sworn. They found for the plaintiff as regards the claim for £15 6s 8d and taxed the damages at 10 marks. Therefore it was considered that the plaintiff recover these sums. Afterwards on 29 Oct. the prior came into court before Nicholas Brembre, Mayor, and the Aldermen, with a writ of the king annulling the protection, and prayed that the defendant might be summoned to answer for the loans. The latter made four defaults, whereupon it was considered that the said £3 13s 4d should be arrested and remain in the prior's hands and be allowed to him as a deduction from a larger sum of money which Robert Aleyn had recovered against him in an Assize of Freshforce heard before the sheriffs, unless the defendant appeared within a year and a day."

The said William acknowledged having spoken these words and put himself on the mercy of the court. He was committed to prison until the Mayor and Aldermen should be advised as to rendering judgment upon him. Afterwards on 26 May he was brought into court. And because the aforesaid words had been spoken falsely and maliciously and expressly redounded to the shame and dishonour of the mayor and other governors of the city, and in order that others might be prevented from speaking like words, it was considered and adjudged, as had previously been done in like cases according to the custom of the city on many other occasions, that the said William should have a year's imprisonment from 18 May and then pay a fine for his contempt according to the discretion of the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being, unless further indulgence should be granted to him in the meantime.

Whereas there had long been dissension and division in the city between divers men of the same, whereby great evil and peril might arise, to the destruction and loss both of the city and of the whole realm, unless remedy were found by the aid of God, and the said mayor and aldermen and other wise men desiring peace, tranquillity, accord, unity and quiet among the people, and wishing to be informed and certified, as far as possible, as to the cause and root of the said dissension and division and how they might be ousted, and unity and accord be made and kept among the people, demand was made of every person, alderman and commoner, by the faith which he owed to God and our lord the king and the oath which he had made to the city, to declare and say openly on his conscience and as he would answer before God, sparing none, what was the cause and root of such dissension and division, whereupon all said severally that it was the life of John Norhampton, for so long as he remained alive all those that were of his covin hoped that he would return to the city and by this hope they comforted others, whereby dissension arose and would always continue so long as he lived. And further, each of them said on his conscience that the thing which would most easily engender unity and accord, and would oust all dissensions and divisions and, in their opinion, would bring the matter to a good end, would be to require and pray our said lord the king in his high and royal majesty that execution of the judgment of law given on the said John Norhampton in the Tower of London should be done, for so long as he lived the said people of his covin and lovers of his opinions would hope for his return to the city as aforesaid, which would be to the utter confusion and destruction of the city, which God forbid. And upon this, with one accord, it was agreed that it would be well for the mayor to take with him certain aldermen and commoners, such as seemed to him good, and to approach our lord the king, petitioning him in the manner and form abovesaid. And also because the mayor and commoners were advised that for the safeguarding of the city and suburbs against any peril that might arise, it would be necessary that a good ditch and a pale above it should be made around all the suburbs of the city for its defence in case need should arise, which God forbid, and because it would take too long to settle the question as to how and in what manner it should be done, since many matters and arguments would be raised among so many men and peradventure no conclusion would be made, it was agreed by everyone that the mayor and aldermen on the morrow should choose from among themselves twelve aldermen and twelve commoners of the most sufficient and discreet men in the city to ordain and treat by what means and how the said matter should be brought into effect, and in what manner the costs which would be needed might be levied, and to do all other things which appertained to the said matter. And all the aldermen and commoners agreed to hold as firm and established whatever the said twentyfour thus elected should do in the matter, and on the morrow the said mayor and aldermen chose the persons underwritten to carry out and perform the said matter, to wit, Sir William Walworth, John Hadle, John Boseham, John Orgon, John Shadworth, Nicholas Exton, Henry Vannere, William Staundon, William More, Robert Warbulton, Thomas Welford and John Fraunceys, aldermen, William Tonge, Adam Karlill, Thomas Rolf, Thomas Girdelere, Henry Herbury, Richard Hatfeld, Thomas Exton, John Loveye, Geoffrey Walderne, John Kirketon, Thomas MakWilliam and Adam Bamme, commoners.

Roll A 27: (i) 1383-85,Membr. 10,1383/03/20,"Matthew Passelewe was summoned to answer John Hende and John Rote, late sheriffs of London, in a plea of debt of £64 due on a bond of 1 Oct. 1381, wherein the plaintiffs by the custom of London produced suit (fn. 40) by their bill exhibited before the Mayor and Aldermen. The defendant pleaded that the bond [French], which was in the names of John Chircheman, himself and Stephen Brown, was security for the payment by the said Stephen of £64 by quarterly portions, that being the amount for which he purchased the bailiwick of the Thames at Billingsgate for the year Michaelmas 1381 to Michaelmas 1382, and that Stephen had paid £32 for the first two quarters. The holders of the bailiwick had always been entitled to such wines and merchandise coming by water to Billingsgate as were forfeited by reason of their having been sold without payment of custom or toll. During Stephen's tenure of the bailiwick a quantity of Rhenish wine and other goods to the value of £100 were forfeited for this reason, but the sheriffs had wrongfully taken the forfeiture, so that the said Stephen was unable to pay the £32 due for the other two quarters. The defendant prayed judgment whether under these circumstances the plaintiffs could maintain their action against him. The plaintiffs protested that they did not acknowledge any such custom as regards forfeitures, and moreover certain forfeitures were reserved to themselves in the agreement. During the time mentioned the only forfeiture was that of certain wines found in the possession of William Sharpyng, vintner, the quantity and value of which they did not know. These wines they had claimed as forfeit on the bailiff's suggestion, and with the latter's consent the question of their value had been settled in the house of John Hende in St Nicholas Lane near Candelwykstrete, where William Sharpyng agreed to pay £10. They were willing to account for this sum to the bailiff. The defendant pleaded that the settlement was made without the bailiff's consent and prevented the bailiff from claiming anything against the said William on account of the forfeiture. On this question of consent a jury was summoned between the parties for the Wednesday following, on which day the defendant offered that if the sheriffs would swear that the agreement was made by consent and in the presence of the bailiff he would admit the debt. The plaintiff John Hende agreed but as the co-plaintiff John Rote was absent from illhealth, a day was given on Saturday. In the meantime, by consent of the parties, William Cheyne, recorder, with Roger Elys, alderman, went on Friday to John Rote's house, where both plaintiffs took the oath. Next day it was considered that the plaintiffs recover £32 against the defendant and 40s damages taxed by the court, and that the said Matthew be in mercy."
Roll A 27: (i) 1383-85,Membr. 10 b,1383/12/16,"John Aunger, boteller, was summoned to answer William Wyndesore, knight, in a plea of debt. The plaintiff's attorney, Richard Forster, declared that on 18 June 1380 in the parish of St Martin Ludgate the defendant had sold to the plaintiff bottles for carrying his wine on the king's service in France and Brittany in the company of the earl of Buckingham, which bottles, though guaranteed as sound, proved to be defective, so that 180 gallons of wine were lost, and afterwards on 14 Sept. 1383 in the church of the Friars Preachers, the parties had put themselves on the arbitration of William Carlil and Thomas Torold, masters of the mistery of Botellers, on the advice of the whole mistery, and the arbitrators found that the bottles were false and awarded that the said John Aunger should repay the cost of the bottles, viz. £18 6s 8d, together with £10 damages to the said William Wyndesore, both of which sums the defendant had refused to pay. The defendant, after protesting that he did not acknowledge any warranty or that the bottles were defective, pleaded that there had been a quarrel between himself and William Carlill, Thomas Torold and John Shadwell, who envied him and wanted to drive him out of the liberty of the city, because he exercised the same trade as themselves. These persons had instigated the plaintiff to bring an action against him in the Sheriffs' Court and afterwards he and the plaintiff had put themselves on the arbitration of Robert Ikford, William Poule, John Goldfynch and Philip de Wodestrete, on condition that none of the three above-mentioned persons should intermeddle therein. As regards the alleged award by William Carlil and Thomas Torold, he maintained that it was contrary to this condition and therefore he prayed judgment as to whether any action lay against him. The plaintiff repeated that the defendant put himself on the award of the above William and Thomas. Process being continued, a jury on 6 July 1384 found that the parties put themselves, as the defendant alleged, on the arbitration of Robert Ikford, William Poule, John Goldfynch and Philip de Wodestrete, who said they could not make an end of the matter unless they had the advice of William Carlill and Thomas Torold, masters of the mistery, and thereupon, by consent of the parties, they were chosen to be in the arbitration, and the whole six of them then made the award in the terms declared by the plaintiff; and the jury assessed the damages, additional to the award, at 40d. The action was adjourned till 21 July that the court might consult as to their judgment, and the defendant was committed to Ludgate for lack of mainprise. As the court wished further inquiry to be made, the jury were summoned again and after being sworn were asked whether William Carlill and Thomas Torold were afterwards elected as arbitrators or merely to advise and inform the arbitrators. The answer was, as arbitrators. Being asked further if the arbitration was made by assent of the mistery of Botellers, the jury replied that it was by assent of six men of the mistery and that there was only one other person belonging to the mistery and he was present when the arbitration was made. Accordingly it was considered, on the whole verdict, that William Wyndesore recover £28 6s 8d, as awarded by the arbitrators, and the damages taxed by the jury at 40d, and that the defendant be in mercy. And for default of payment the defendant was committed to Ludgate until he paid."

And whereas the said master on 15 Sept. the same year in the parish of St Michael Queenhithe delivered to Nicholas Leykman, his apprentice, the sum of 205 marks in gold and sent him to travel with other merchants to Bordeaux in Gascony, to trade therewith to the best of his ability, as apprentices are bound to do according to the custom of the city, at the same time sending the said John with him to learn the business, when the apprentices arrived at Plymouth with the gold, which lay in a locked box in a London ship, of which Lawrence Ches was master, together with other goods of the complainant, the said John went aboard, at a time when the other apprentice was ashore, and broke into the box and carried away the 205 marks, to the complainant's damage £200, whereof he prayed a remedy according to the law merchant and the custom of the city. The said John, who was present in court, being sworn and examined according to the custom as to the taking away of the money, admitted the greater part but said nothing about the rest, and in answer to matters put to him by the court continually varied his story. Thereupon in order to obtain the truth the two apprentices were examined separately. Both of them swore that the said John had eloigned the money, but the apprentice Nicholas acknowledged having received from John, by the hands of John Mersham, the sum of £40. A day was given on 1 Feb. that the court might be advised as to giving judgment, and the said John was committed to Ludgate for lack of mainprise, on which day it was considered that the said Thomas recover £100 13s 4d and £10 damages, beyond the £40 already repaid and £20 received from the friends of the said John by reason of the apprenticeship, and for default of payment the said John was committed to prison. Afterwards on 23 Sept. 1385 the master prayed that the apprentice might be released to him on bail until 28 Sept. as he was so sick that his life was despaired of. The boy was returned to prison on that day, but on 15 Dec. the same year the master again asked that the apprentice might be released on bail until 24 June 1386 for the same reason, which was allowed by the court on condition that he save the sheriffs harmless."

Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 18,1385/07/21,"Simon Wynchecoumbe, late one of the sheriffs of London, brought a bill of complaint against Thomas Beton, baker, who had received from him the office of janitor of his compter (fn. 10) in Walbrook on 28 Sept. 1383 and had undertaken to guard all prisoners until Michaelmas following, saving the said Simon harmless, as appeared by his deed. Nevertheless a certain Simon Stacy, shipman, who had been arrested on 11 Jan. 1384 at the suit of John Brencheley, esquire, on a writ of justicies for detinue of chattels to the value of £200, escaped on 9 Feb. 1384. Thereupon John Brencheley sued the plaintiff by bill in the parliament (fn. 11) held at Salisbury after Easter, the bill being endorsed and sent to Chancery, whence a writ was issued summoning the plaintiff to answer John Brencheley there. Finally an award (fn. 12) was given that Simon Stacy had been delivered from prison without due process of law and the plaintiff was condemned in £200, for which John Brenchele was suing execution. Although the plaintiff had required the defendant to save him harmless, he had refused, to the plaintiff's damage £1000. [French] The parties appeared on 24 July, when the plaintiff produced an agreement dated 28 Sept. 1383, whereby John Knesworth, John Bally, clerk, William Averey, clerk, Edmund Fraunceys, Bartholomew Berford, John Gravesende, Stephen Maynard, John Cook, corsour, Thomas Beton, baker, William Fader, carpenter, John Staunton, brewer, Robert Brampton, saddler, and John Groos, baker, received the office of janitor of the compter in Walbrook and custody of the prison for a year from Michaelmas 1383, covenanting to answer therefor and to save the sheriff harmless under penalty of the goods of each and all of them. The defendant, after the bill and deed had been read, pleaded that in the record of Chancery between John Brenchelay and Simon Wynchecoumbe, the latter acknowledged that he had Simon Stacy in his custody at the time when John Brenchelay delivered to him the writ of justicies, and as the said John did not produce pledges for prosecution or begin or demand that process be made, the said Simon and his colleague John More had liberated Simon Stacy on 26 Jan. 1384, and between the reception of the writ and that date there had. been several Sheriffs' Courts. Further the defendant pleaded that after the 26 Jan., when, as the sheriff admitted in Chancery, the prisoner had been liberated, the latter had not been arrested or detained in his compter on account of any action of the said John Brenchelay. And accordingly, since the plaintiff and his colleague had voluntarily released Simon Stacy, the defendant prayed judgment whether the plaintiff could maintain his action against him contrary to the record in Chancery, of which the tenor was as follows:  Pleas before the lord king in his Chancery at Westminster on the octave of S t Hilary A o 8 Ric. II (20 Jan. 1385)"
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 18 b,1385/07/21,"Writ reciting that John de Brencheleye had complained by a petition exhibited in the last parliament, that whereas Simon Stacy had been arrested by virtue of a writ of justicies and John de Brencheleye had subsequently gone abroad in the company of John, duke of Lancaster, a precept had been issued to the sheriffs to keep the said Simon in custody till a certain day, but the sheriff, Simon de Wynchecoumbe, by arrangement with the said Simon Stacy, had delivered him from prison long before the day mentioned in the precept, and that in cunning excuse for thus liberating him, he had procured a writ in Chancery demanding the cause of the arrest of the said Simon, and that consequent upon the return of the writ, which was to the effect that the said Simon was detained in prison at the suit of Hugh de Brencheleye, a precept had been issued from Chancery ordering the delivery of the said Simon if he were detained for no other reason—although the said Simon had already been liberated—wherefore the said John de Brencheleye prayed the king in parliament for a remedy. Accordingly the sheriffs are now ordered to warn Simon de Wynchecoumble to appear in Chancery on the Thursday following to answer for his contempt and deceit and to show cause why he should not make satisfaction to John de Brencheleye to the value of the goods and chattels claimed. Dated at Westminster 8 Oct. 1384. In obedience to the writ Simon de Wynchecoumbe appeared in Chancery and declared that there was no custom in the city with regard to a writ of justicies other than the common law. He pleaded that on 1 Jan. 1384 a plea of detinue of chattels had been affirmed at the suit of Hugh de Brencheleye, whereby Simon Stacy had been taken and detained in Newgate, that afterwards a writ of justicies on behalf of John de Brencheleye had been delivered to the sheriffs, upon which writ no pledges for prosecution were ever offered on the part of the plaintiff nor any process made or demanded, and that on 4 Jan. the king sent his writ under the privy seal directing that, whereas John de Brencheleye was departing for Calais to join the duke of Lancaster on the king's business, the sheriffs keep Simon Stacy under arrest until Easter or until John de Brencheleye returned, if this were consonant with the laws and customs of the city. Afterwards on 8 Jan. the king sent a writ of certiorari demanding the cause of the taking and detaining of Simon Stacy, to which it was returned that he was kept in prison at the suit of Hugh de Brencheleye, esquire. Thereupon friends of Simon Stacy moved the sheriff for his delivery, asserting that his detaining in prison was against the law, because John de Brencheleye did not find pledges for prosecution on the writ nor begin or continue process as he ought, nor did Hugh de Brencheleye prosecute his plaint after the above return. Accordingly the sheriffs, after, taking the opinion of wise and discreet men of the city as to whether Simon Stacy could be legally detained, released him on 26 Jan., before which day and after the receipt of the writ of justicies divers Sheriffs' Courts had been held (at which process could have been made). Afterwards on 2 Feb. the king sent a writ ordering the release of Simon Stacy because divers men had mainprised him in Chancery; without that (fn. 13) Simon Stacy had been arrested for any other cause than here stated or that Simon de Wynchecoumbe had procured the writ of certiorari. John de Brencheleye, while protesting that he did not acknowledge that no pledges for prosecution had been offered or process made, said that whereas Simon de Wynchecoumbe had admitted that the justicies had been received long before the precept (to detain Simon Stacy until Easter) and whereas it was clear from the return to the certiorari that the said Simon was detained in prison at the suit of both the said John de Brencheleye and Hugh de Brencheleye (fn. 14), and thus his arrest and detaining ought to be understood as haying legally taken place at the suit of John de Brencheleye, he prayed judgment as to whether Simon de Wynchecoumbe ought to be admitted to verify his statement that Simon Stacy had been detained at the suit of Hugh alone. Whereupon the pleadings having been heard, and it being understood that the Sheriffs' Courts were held on no fixed days but at the discretion of the sheriffs (fn. 15), and that no notice had been given to John de Brencheleye of the holding of any court, and the sheriff did not claim to have summoned him to any court, in consequence of which judgment might have been given against him for failure to attend, and without such judgment the other party, being attached to answer, ought not legally to have been acquitted, and also on the ground that Simon de Wynchecoumbe could not be admitted to verify that Simon Stacy had been arrested for some other reason than that stated on his own return to the writ, and further because it did not appear that there was any great need (fn. 16) for prosecutions on writs of justicies to be affirmed by pledges, for these and other reasons it seemed to the court that Simon de Wynchecoumbe had not said anything to clear himself. Accordingly it was considered that John de Brencheleye recover against him chattels to the value of £200, that being the amount claimed against Simon Stacy, and that the question of damages and the punishment of Simon de Wynchecoumbe for his deceit be left for further consideration (fn. 17). Writ of mittimus, dated 3 May 1385, to the Mayor and Aldermen that the tenor of the proceedings in Chancery had been sent to them in order that they might proceed in the action of Simon de Wynchecoumbe against John Knesworth, Thomas Beton, baker, and others."
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 19,1385/07/21,"The plaintiff, Simon Wynchecoumbe, did not acknowledge the allegation of the defendant but said that Simon Stacy escaped and was delivered from prison without his assent and by default of the defendant, who was his servant and gaoler, and that the defendant ought not to be excused on the ground of allegations made against the plaintiff, because, although the defaults and actions of a sheriff's servant were the defaults of the sheriff as regards other parties, the servant was bound to answer the sheriff as between themselves. And whereas he said in Chancery that Simon Stacy was delivered (by the advice of wise and discreet men etc.), the truth was that he escaped by default of the defendant, and the wise and discreet men were the defendant and the others mentioned in the agreement. Accordingly, since the defendant did not deny that Simon Stacy did, in fact, escape, he prayed judgment. The defendant denied that he advised the sheriff to liberate Simon Stacy, and he was prepared to verify his denial, if he could make it the issue of the action. Moreover he was willing to verify that Simon Stacy who was delivered on 26 Jan. was not arrested and detained in the compter after that date, and as regards any escape before that date he had no need to answer. After further pleadings and adjournments, on 27 Feb. 1386 the parties appeared, when it seemed to the court that the defendant was bound to save the plaintiff harmless notwithstanding any answer the latter was alleged to have made, in case of any escape of the said Simon Stacy, and that the defendant did not keep his covenant. Therefore it was considered that the plaintiff recover against him the sum of £200 which John de Brencheley had recovered against the plaintiff in Chancery, and that the defendant be committed to prison, while the question of damages be left for further consideration. Afterwards the king sent three writs, primum, sicut alias and sicut pluries, demanding the record and process of the above action to be returned to Chancery, and the Mayor and Aldermen returned the sicut alias with a roll attached thereto, containing the record and process."

Return to the above in a cedula attached to the writ: The mayor had summoned William Coudeberk and Simon Brame, who testified as abovesaid, but did not know whether the goods arrested with William Matys were his own or not. Thereupon the mayor had summoned William Matys, who swore that all the goods were his own and none belonged to the king's enemies of Bruges. But previous to the receipt of the king's writs, Richard Odyham, Matthew Passelewe and John Sutton, citizens of London, had come and complained that the goods in question belonged not only to the said William but also to Wltre Gaffulkyn, one of the king's enemies of Bruges, the two being partners (intermercatores) in the goods, and that certain of the king's enemies belonging both to Bruges and Sluys, in time of truce between the king and France, had taken and carried away divers goods belonging to the complainants from a ship sailing from Zeeland to London at a place called ""Vergat (fn. 18),"" contrary to the truce, viz. three bales of battery belonging to Richard of the value of £63, a hundred bales of roche alum belonging to Matthew of the value of £140 and a bale of Cyprus cotton belonging to John of the value of £8, wherefore they prayed that the goods of the said William Matys might be arrested, as being the goods both of William Matys and Wltre Gaffulkyn, and that the portion belonging to the latter be delivered to them as a reprisal in part satisfaction for their own goods.

They recommend themselves to the best of their knowledge and power to his most redoubtable and puissant lordship the duke. They have understood the contents of the letters sent to Sir Nicholas Brembre, mayor, which they recite. In this matter it seems to them that the duke is not duly informed and that untrue suggestions have been made to him against the mayor. Whereas the duke ascribes the above-mentioned actions to the mayor and no one else, they assure his highness that in truth the steps taken to limit the pardon after the duke's departure were not only the action and motion of the mayor but the action and motion of all of them, undertaken for the benefit and peace of the city, and that they had made strong representations to him as their mayor, because at present it seemed to them that the coming of the above-mentioned persons or any of them, and especially of John Norhampton, so near to the city as the duke wished, as appeared by his letters, would be a great cause of unrest to the city and the occasion of great tribulation and discontent within the city, to the subversion of the same, and thus would prove very displeasing to his lordship the king and to the duke himself and to the whole kingdom, which thing they hoped their honoured lord would in no wise desire; and accordingly the mayor, by reason of his office, and they themselves, for their common good and the ease and quietness of the people and in order to prevent any such danger arising in despite of the king and themselves, had agreed that the mayor should move in the matter, and if the duke had remained longer in the country, they would have approached his lordship concerning the same, and especially because the king had previously granted to the commonalty of the city by his letters patent, for greater assurance of peace and quietness, that none of the aforementioned persons should approach nearer to the city than 100 leagues within the boundaries of England, wherefore they hoped that the duke, after good consideration, would hold the mayor and themselves as excused on this point. Furthermore, at the instance of the mayor and aldermen, and in order to give pleasure to the king and the duke, they had by common assent agreed to remit 20 leagues of the 100 leagues aforesaid. They begged his lordship to give no credence to any suggestions made against their request or against themselves or the city until he had received full information therein and considered their answer to the same. They had entire trust in the duke that he was more anxious for their peace and good than to aid and sustain persons who for so long, both in the time of the late king, the duke's father, whom God assoil, and in the time of the present king, had been regarded as rioters, brawlers, disturbers of the peace, initiators and maintainers of common quarrels and riots in the city, and as such notified and published as well in places of record as in the said city, being men engaged to the utmost of their power in oppressing the people and subverting the city, and as such arrested and imprisoned by just commandment of the king and of his noble council and by the mayor and officers of the city, and for such causes, and others more heinous, duly attainted in the time of the present king both on their own confession and in other ways. They prayed that God of his benign grace would give to his redoubtable and puissant lordship a good and long life and good success to him and all his friends and helpers and victory over all his enemies. Written at London under the common seal of the said city the 23rd day of May. From the duke's servants, the Aldermen and Commonalty of the city of London. [French] Reply from Sir Nicholas Brembre in identical terms. As regards the matter touching the inheritance of John Norhampton's wife and children, he had never urged reasons to the contrary. He concludes his letter ""le vostre si vous plest Nichol Brembre."" [French]"
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 27,1385/07/20,"Adam Bamme, late one of the sheriffs of London, was summoned to answer Simon Aylsham, mercer, in a plea of debt, wherein the latter complained that on 24 Nov. 1382 in the Sheriffs' Court he sued Nicholas Rudere of Bruges, attorney of Peter Clerk, merchant of Bruges, to render account of £1000. As the said Nicholas was not a freeman and had no goods in the city, he was taken on a capias and brought to Adam's compter in Milk Street, whence he escaped on the Wednesday following. And accordingly, since in such a case the sheriff was bound by the use and custom of the city to satisfy the plaintiff for the sum in virtue of which the imprisonment took place, action accrued to the plaintiff for that amount. The defendant, while protesting that he did not acknowledge the date or the amount or that the custom was as large as was alleged, pleaded that the said Nicholas was attached previous to 30 Nov., that process was continued till a court held on 3 Dec., when friends informed John Norhampton, then mayor, that the said Nicholas was a foreigner and had been long in prison, and prayed the mayor to order the defendant, as sheriff, to deliver him according to custom. Thereupon the mayor, in Simon's presence, had ordered him to send for Nicholas the same day and told Simon to attend the Sheriffs' Court to prosecute his claim if he so wished. The latter made default, whereupon judgment was given that he and his pledges be in mercy and that Nicholas go quit. Moreover, adjournments in the Sheriffs' Court were not to a fixed day, but from one court to another; without that (fn. 44) Nicholas left the prison before Simon failed to prosecute. Accordingly he prayed judgment whether Simon had any action against him. The plaintiff said that Adam's plea was double: first that, as courts were adjourned from one court to another, no fixed day could be given him, and secondly, that the mayor had ordered him to hear the plea the very same day, and so no fixed day could be given. He asked to be exonerated from one of these pleas. The said Adam answered that he had alleged all these matters merely to explain how the plaintiff had not prosecuted his claim according to law, which was sufficient to excuse himself. He prayed judgment. The action was adjourned for the information of the court until 14 Sept., when the plaintiff, while not admitting the defendant's allegations about the mayor's precept, pleaded that adjournments in the Sheriffs' Court were not as alleged, but that the sheriffs, on taking office, arranged to hold their courts alternately, one taking Wednesday and Friday and the other Thursday and Saturday, such days being called ""juridici (fn. 45),"" and the defendant, as sheriff, had the two latter days; further that according to custom neither need hold more courts than twice a week, except by consent of the parties or for the delivery of foreigners, this kind of court being called a ""foreign"" court, and that in such foreign courts no free man ought to be compelled to prosecute his claim of debt or account, except by consent of the parties (fn. 46), or unless a day's notice had been given in a case where a plaintiff, having a dies juridicus next after the common adjournments, had no counsel then present. The plaintiff further pleaded that the defendant's juridical days were Thursday and Saturday and that on Saturday 29 Nov. the parties appeared in his court, but as there was no opportunity of discussing the case a day was given for Thursday following, yet nevertheless on the Wednesday at 11 o'clock before noon the said Adam suddenly required the plaintiff, without his counsel and without warning, to prosecute his plea, to which, in the presence of Sir William Walworth and other aldermen, he answered that he need not prosecute because the day had not been assigned to him, and his counsel was not present, and he was not warned to plead in a ""foreign"" court, and he requested the said Adam to defer any steps as to liberating the said Nicholas Until the next day, which had been assigned to him. And accordingly, since the delivering of the said Nicholas was without warrant and unjust, he prayed damages against the said Adam. The defendant pleaded in answer that the court and the authority of the sheriffs were whole and not divided, that according to the custom of the city they could hold personal actions daily and often did so, especially where a foreign merchant was defendant, and that the mayors of London had always had the power, when an impleaded person complained of any delay or wrong in the Sheriffs' Court, to order the sheriffs in the presence of the parties to hold a court the same day, terminate the plea and deliver the parties notwithstanding any common adjournment in the Sheriffs' Court. Moreover the plaintiff, who was present in Guildhall, did not come before him or any of his officers to say that he had no counsel present or make any excuse at all, but clearly did not prosecute his claim, though he was frequently exacted, all of which the defendant was ready to verify by his record or in such manner as the court should direct. Wherefore he prayed judgment whether the plaintiff could assign any injury to him personally or ought to have his action against him. The plaintiff said that the defendant did not deny his allegation, and as regards his making no excuse about his counsel, he said that he warned the defendant thereof in the Guildhall in the presence of the Mayor and Aldermen, which the defendant had not denied, wherefore he prayed judgment. Afterwards process being continued day by day until 29 Jan. 1388, the said Simon did not come to prosecute his plea. Therefore he and his pledges in mercy."
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 28,1386/01/30,"Richard Gromet, Roger Sket, John Gyot, Arnaud Wrighte, Simon Edelonde, John Pottere, John Soudere, Adam Pottere, Robert Wyse, Thomas Helond, Roger Goudyng and Roger Gromet, fishermen of the country eastwards of London Bridge, were sworn before the Mayor and Aldermen to inform them how and by whom the fish in the Thames were so destroyed that hardly a seasonable fish could be found in it, what the nets in use were and how wide was the mesh, and whether it would be more profitable for the common people that the mesh of the nets for smelts and gojons should be of the assize of one inch, or an inch and a half, and for how long they ought to use such nets for such fish. The fishermen said on oath that destruction was mainly done by treinkes (fn. 47) and weres, and by hebbyngnettes (fn. 48) put in fletes (fn. 49) and shores (fn. 50) in the water and in the bruche (fn. 51) towards Berkyng, and of these treinkes, one each was owned by John Taillour of Wolwych, John Swyft, John Erhithe, Smalbourne, Robert Tripecok of Plumsted, Richard Wayn, John London of Erhithe, John Colyn, John Baterell, Philip Erhithe, Thomas Geffray of Hamme, John Shipman and William Danyel, and there were several others whose names they did not know. They said also that Salomon Prat of Popeler, John Brewere of Hamme, Thomas Wrighte, Daniel de Brambelegh, Walter Taillour, John Thressher of Popeler, John Shipman of Hamme, John Galyon of Wolwyche and John Godesone had each of them weres, and there were several others whose names they did not know. Further, the fish usually entered at the breche on the land of the abbot of Stratford and the abbess of Berkyng in order to feed on the land there and to be more at ease and more swef (fn. 52) than in the current of the Thames, and there they stayed till the tide ebbed and they could not pass back to the river but betook themselves to the ditches which remained full of water, which ditches the abbot and abbess hired out to people who put weres and other engyns in them, against the assize, whereby all fish, great and small, being unable to pass, were destroyed, and thus the abbot and abbess were the principal maintainers of the destruction of fish. They said further that nets of an inch in the mesh were always, time out of mind, used for smelts and gojons, and the fishing began fifteen days before Candlemas (2 Feb.) and lasted till the feast of our Lady in Lent (25 March). During this period they held that it would be best for the people to fish with nets of narrow mesh, since smelts and gojons could not be taken with larger mesh. No fisherman ought to draw any net called a ""draghenet (fn. 53) "" to land during this season between the Tower and London Bridge, and no one ought to fish at any season of the year, except in the time of smelts, with a mesh less than two inches. The fishermen also said that samoun and sturgon were utterly destroyed by weres and treinkes, and that there was another kind of net called ""forstate (fn. 54) "" with which a man could fish all the year, of which the mesh should be two inches of assize and no narrower. [French] John Heldere, Thomas Fynch, John Spray, Peter Colman, John Couche, Robert Pulter, John Gybon, John Never, Laurence Sprillyng, William Grene, Richard West and William Neve, fishermen of the west of London Bridge, sworn the same day, said that between the Purification (2 Feb.) and the feast of our Lady in Lent (25 March) it had always been usual to fish with a smeltnet, having a mesh of an inch, for smelts and gudgeons, without dragging these nets anywhere to land near London, but fishing only in the middle of the stream, and hitherto they had had leave to fish with such nets fourteen days before the Purification, if the season required it, i.e. in swef and mol (fn. 55) times when the scoue (fn. 56) of smelt and gudgeons drew closer to the land, which it did not do in cold and hard times. Also they said they had been used to fish with nets of a two-inch mesh all through the year except nine days before and nine days after the feast of St Mark (25 April), which was the spawning season for roach, that no nets ought to be drawn to land anywhere near London in any season of the year unless the meshes were two inches wide, and that salmon ought (not?) to be taken between the feast of the Nativity of our Lady (8 Sept.) and the feast of St Martin (11 Nov.) because at this time it was kiper (fn. 57), out of season and of no value. They had been used to take lampreies throughout the year except in May, which was their season of spawning. Lamprons (fn. 58) could be taken at any time except between Hokkeday (Tuesday after Easterday) and the Feast of St Lawrence (10 Aug.), which was their season of spawning. Also they said that many people had recently made weres called ""routes (fn. 59) "" near Braynford (fn. 60) and Istelworth, whereby small fish were destroyed, that there were other weirs which stopped the common course of the water, so that no vessel could pass without great trouble, and that at the Westwere at Braynford and at Brainte great destruction of fish was done by engyns called ""wilwes (fn. 61)."" [French] Thereupon it was agreed by the Mayor and Aldermen that, whereas divers persons fish with smeltnets of one-inch mesh after the season above-mentioned in open destruction of fish large and small, in future anyone wishing to fish with such nets should find sufficient security among the good men of London that within eight days after the said feast of our Lady they would bring their nets to the Guildhall to remain there for the ensuing year under safe custody, permission being given to their owners to come to the Guildhall to see that their nets were well kept, and at a reasonable time to be limited by the Mayor and Aldermen before the feast of the Purification they should have delivery of their nets to mend and repair them and to fish with them during the said season and no longer. Further, each fisherman should swear to do this loyally and not to fish with any net or engine contrary to the ordinance in destruction of fish, and if any one be found fishing with such net after the feast of our Lady in Lent, the nets should be burnt and the owner put to such penance, at the discretion of the Mayor and Aldermen, as befitted one who destroyed the common food."
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 28,1386/06/20,"William Pyg of Westhamme was mainprised by Elias Braybrok and William Pycot not to put any net called ""treinke"" in the Thames except during the time and season when, by ancient custom, such nets were used."
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 28 b,1386/07/21,"Ralph Tot, John Roger, Gilbert Peny, William Smalbourne, Thomas Frost, Adam Clement and John Normanton of Wolwych came before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Inner Chamber of the Guildhall and were charged with having assaulted John Salisbury, surveyor of the Thames, who had been appointed to take, remove and destroy all nets and engines whereby fry were destroyed, by shooting arrows at him, and further, with having put weres and other engines of too narrow mesh in the water, contrary to the ancient ordinances of the king and of the city. The defendants admitted the charge and put themselves on the favour of the Mayor and Aldermen, who granted, on account of their humility, that they should be bound over under mainprise. Thereupon they were mainprised by John Horn and others that none of them would interfere in future with John Salisbury or any other officer of the city in the discharge of his duty, nor place too narrow weirs, treinkes or other engines in the water, that they would assist and comfort the officers in their work, and that they would hinder and bring to the notice of the mayor all persons so offending, unless they were able to castigate and punish them themselves. They were also sworn not to do any harm to the men of Stebbenhithe (fn. 62) or their goods except by due process of law, under penalty of £100. The said John Horn agreed and promised in good faith to produce, on their return, John Erhithe and John Godessone, who had been charged with the same offences, and were then at sea with the Admiral on the king's service. The same day John Gyot, Roger Sket, John Pottere and John Soudere of Stebbenhithe were mainprised by John Trigge, fishmonger, not to harm any man of Wolwych under penalty of £40."

Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 29,1386/05/10,"Adam Botoner of Coventry, by John Kesteven and John Trumpton his attorneys, brought a bill before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber, complaining that John Dilcok, son of the complainant's wife Margaret and her former husband Henry Dilcok, had been bound apprentice to John More and had served five years of his term, during which time his master had not enrolled him, nor given him any instruction during the last year and a half, nor handed him over to any one else of the same trade to learn the trade, nor provided him with food and clothing, as he was bound to do. He prayed that the said John might be released from his apprenticeship. The court, while agreeing that John More (fn. 63) neither could nor ought to come to the city, nevertheless desired, on the ground of equity (fn. 64), to know whether he had anything to say to the contrary, and accordingly they warned his wife Alice to report the matter to her husband and to appear on 8 June to inform them whether her husband had any objections to offer. The said Alice did not appear nor did any one else come on behalf of John More. Accordingly, since he was reported to be fully informed of the matter and gave no reasons to the contrary, and because he had not enrolled his apprentice within the first year of his term according to custom, as appeared by a scrutiny of the books of the Chamber of Guildhall, nor had he instructed him etc., and further because he had himself been ousted from the freedom of the city by the king's justices sitting at the Tower for certain felonies and treasons confessed by him, and thus was unable to exercise his trade, it was considered, according to custom in the like case, that the said John Dilcok should be exonerated from his apprenticeship and should serve whom he would notwithstanding his indentures, and that his mainpernors in the indentures, namely, the said Adam and Richard Dodenhale, should be released from their mainprise."
Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 29,1386/06/10,"Memorandum that Hugh Richardesson of Southampton, who was warden and governor (custos et gubernator) of a balinger (fn. 65) called ""le Marie de Excestre,"" was attached in the Sheriffs' Court to answer Philip Travers of Calais, attorney of John Bedon, scutifer (fn. 66) of Calais, for the profits of the balinger, which belonged to John Bedon. The action having been removed to the Mayor's Court, the parties put themselves on the arbitration of Richard de Preston and Richard Toky, good men of the city. On 4 July 1386 the latter reported that John Bedon owed Hugh the sum of £6 for the expenses of the balinger and was claiming from him an account of the sum of 40 frankes, which Hugh had received for a prisoner of Calais, and of a further sum of 10 marks which had been entrusted to him, and also of moneys received for freights from Middelburgh to London. This account Hugh could not give in the absence of John Bedon. They awarded that Hugh should enter into security to go to Calais as soon as possible to render an account to John Bedon, and that the £6 should be paid to him."

John Bradele appeared on 12 April and asked for an adjournment to take advice, and a day was given him for 28 June. Appearing on that date he pleaded that none of the goods of the late Thomas Willyngham had come into his hands at the time the precept was issued or afterwards. A jury from the venue of Dowgate brought in a verdict for him on this issue. It was considered that the said John go quit and that the said George be not amerced for a false claim because he was an orphan."

Roll A 27: (ii) 1385-86,Membr. 30,1386/07/30,"Joan Thurkull was summoned to answer Robert Fraunkeleyn, dyer, in a plea that whereas he let to her a tenement in the parish of St James Garlickhithe for a year from Easter 1385 at a rent of 40s, payable quarterly, to be held afterwards at will and given up on reasonable notice, and at the end of the year he gave her a quarter's notice, nevertheless she refused to quit, to his damage 40s. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff agreed, in the presence of a certain Robert Kent, who was acting for him, to let the tenement to her for thirty years at 40s a year, and that she gave him a God's penny (fn. 69) as earnest of the covenant, and that on Shrove Tuesday (14 Feb.) 1385, as the tenement was empty, he allowed her to occupy it for a year without rent, after which he again recognised the covenant. She prayed that, in accordance with the custom of the city, the said Robert Kent, who acted as broker, should be examined on oath. The plaintiff agreed. Robert Kent, being summoned, appeared the same day and said on oath that it had been agreed that the defendant should have the tenement for thirty years, if she wished, and that the plaintiff would not expel her or raise the rent. Accordingly it was considered by the court that the defendant hold the tenement for thirty years, if she wished, and if she died, it should return to the plaintiff, and that the latter be not amerced because he came the first day. But as the plaintiff had slandered her, calling her a prostitute, he was committed to prison. Next day the plaintiff, together with Richard Bruer, John Grenefeld, goldsmith, and William Sherman, who had also slandered and threatened her, were mainprised for their good behaviour, and the plaintiff's servant, John Wakefeld, was likewise bound over under surety of his master.

The said William having died, Walter Dautrey, claiming to represent Robert Sutton, came to John Hoo and gave him the first letter of payment according to the law merchant and showed him the second letter of payment and the obligation and asked for payment. John Hoo was willing to pay, but the above-mentioned Thomas Maperley put in a claim. The court summoned both parties, and on Thomas Maperley's making default, it was considered that John Hoo should pay the money direct to Robert Sutton on condition that he warranted him against any other claimant."

The broker answered on oath as follows: Lord de Neville sold these tallies of the king; amounting to more than £400, to Francis Wincheguerre, who asked the witness to take them to Hull and buy wool with them to that value or beyond. Matthew Cheynyn, hearing that he was going to Hull, also asked him to take a king's tally of £100 and buy wool for him. When he arrived in Hull, the king's customs-officer showed him some wool, but would not strike a bargain because he was himself coming to London in a fortnight and wanted to talk with the principals about the bargain, so that the witness had his journey for nothing. However, when the customs-officer came to London, Francis Wincheguerre, by the witness' agency, bought from him 30 sarplers of wool, 20 of one sort and 10 of another; which amounted to far more than the value of the tallies, whereupon he paid him the balance and everything was settled.

By his bill of complaint, the plaintiff alleged that on 8 Oct. last at Wasshecrosse near Fossedyke (fn. 25) the defendant freighted his ship "" Seintemariebote"" with 30 weys of salt to be carried to London at 5s the wey, which salt the plaintiff carried to London, where the defendant unloaded the greater part of it without paying the plaintiff anything for the freight. Accordingly he prayed that £7 12s 6d arising from the sale of the salt might be arrested as a foreign attachment and delivered to him according to the custom of the city, and he produced the covenant between them dated 8 Oct. The defendant having made four defaults, the plaintiff prayed that John Wykes, the serjeant of the Chamber, who had made and received the aforesaid sum out of the sale of part of the salt, should pay it to him. Thereupon, according to the custom, the plaintiff was put on oath as to how much was really owed to him. He said the amount was as abovesaid, but he had borrowed 40s from the defendant. Accordingly it was considered that this sum should be deducted and that the plaintiff receive £5 12s 6d. But as it was clear from the indenture that the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff for his freightage within seven days after he had tied up in London, and if he failed to do so or to land the salt he should after the seven days pay the plaintiff 3s 4d a day for his expenses, and since the plaintiff had tarried with his ship for ten further days, with his freight unpaid and with the salt still not discharged, owing to the defendant's default, as was testified by many witnesses, it was considered that he receive 33s 4d more. The serjeant of the Chamber then paid him the two amounts and he was mainprised by Edmund Bys and Nicholas Brandon to restore it, if the defendant within a year and a day submitted to justice and was able to prove reasonably that he was not liable for the debt and damages. Nicholas Brembre, knight, came before the mayor and recorder and acknowledged the following writing to be his deed: Grant from Nicholas Brembre to William Venour, Henry Vanner, Edmund Halsted, Thomas Broun and John Soles, citizens and merchants of London, of all his goods and chattels, live and dead, of whatsoever kind and wherever they might be, as well within the city as elsewhere this side of or beyond the seas, to have and to hold to them, to do and dispose thereof as their own goods without any reclamation or condition whatsoever.

The Mayor and Aldermen sent for Robert Parys and Robert Havelok, masters of the mistery of Ironmongers, who said on oath that the master had no shop in London after Dec. 1386 and did not provide for his apprentice. Afterwards the Mayor and Aldermen, hearing that John Grove, armourer, was attorney of the said master in England, sent for him in order to have fuller information. He admitted the truth of the complaint but opposed the exoneration on the ground that the apprentice had not rendered account. To this the apprentice replied that he had given security by a bond in £600 from himself, John Marchal and John Algate to render account, which bond John Grove had accepted. Evidence was given that he had gone to his master in Middelburgh to make the account, but his master refused to receive it.

In witness whereof the jurors to this inquest have set their seals. And because the said indictment made no mention of a certain time or place and thus was of no force at law, the said John Donyngton etc. were told by the court that they were not bound to answer the indictment, and if it were of any force, they could exonerate themselves by the king's letters patent whereby he pardoned to his liege men of London and each of them and the whole commonalty of London—except those who were adjudged to be convicted of the discord and dissension in the city, and others who had withdrawn themselves outside the city for the said causes and hitherto had not returned to their obedience and to surrender to the peace, whose names were exhibited in the king's chancery to be entered of record—the suit of his peace which pertains to him for all treasons, felonies, insurrections, trespasses, conspiracies, confederacies, leagues and all other misprisions against his royal majesty within the city before the date of his letters patent, whereof any, being indicted or accused, had not been convicted or might in future be indicted or accused, and granted his sure peace to them in the premises, which letters patent were dated 22 June Ao 9 (1385). The said John Donyngton etc. said they did not wish to seek any benefit from the above letters and craved leave to answer the indictment, whereupon they were severally charged and pleaded not guilty and put themselves for good or ill upon the country. A jury of John Colshull and his fellows, being sworn and charged, found them not guilty. Accordingly it was considered that they go quit thereof; and because it seemed to the court that the indictment was of no force nor was anyone bound to answer to it by law, it was considered that no process be made on it against John Maudeleyne, Robert Riseby, William Norton, John Chedder, mercer, and John Vyne, mercer, who were likewise named in it.

Afterwards Thomas died aged two years and John aged three years, and accordingly their shares fell in to Joan. The defendant pleaded that Geoffrey Colewelle and others were also appointed executors, that the goods came into the hands of the said Geoffrey, and that she herself neither received nor administered them. The plaintiffs answered that Geoffrey was the testator's apprentice and continued as Alice's apprentice for seven years and that together they administered the goods in the parish of St Pancras. On this issue a jury of the venue, which was summoned for 2 May 1388, brought in a verdict that the defendant, as executrix, administered the goods.

[French] The defendant appeared on 13 Feb. and a day was given him on 30 July, that he might in the meantime make inquiries among merchants trading at Middelburgh. On that day the parties chose arbitrators, John Walcote and Richard Wyllesdon, on behalf of the plaintiff, and Thomas Girdlere and Richard Toky, on behalf of the defendant, to give an award on 19 Dec. Before that date, however, a certain William Brampton came into court with a bill, in which he stated that he had been chosen umpire, because the arbitrators could not agree, and that he had come into the Chamber of the Guildhall on 17 Dec. to give an award as regards one part of the dispute, his award being that a certain letter under the great seal of the Staple of Middelburgh, which had been delivered to Thomas Hoke, the plaintiff's attorney, by William Brampton, governor of the Staple, should be annulled and cancelled, because it had been issued only to establish a right over the apprentice and not to prejudice any proceedings in England, and thereupon the letter had been handed over to Henry Perot, clerk of the Guildhall (fn. 34), to be destroyed, and that further he had adjudged that no plea should be begun till Easter, the matter remaining in his hands meanwhile, since he intended either to appear personally then or to send a final award under his seal. [French]"
Roll A 28: 1386-88,Membr. 10 b,1387/01/28,"As the said William Brampton did not send his award at Easter, the plaintiff craved leave to proceed to a plea. But the court, wishing to know whether he had made a definite award or not, and considering that a letter from Middelburgh might easily have been delayed by contrary winds or other causes, wrote to him a letter under the mayoralty seal [French] on 11 April 1388, urging him to send the award. To this he replied by a letter dated at Middelburgh on 20 May, excusing himself for not attending in London, because he was unable to come, and stating that the apprentice, John Northampton, had arrived in Middelburgh without any merchandise, gold or silver, except his bare expenses, and while there he had neither bought nor sold anything nor made any exchanges, as was clear from the evidence of merchants and from a search which he had made in the books where such exchanges were registered, but that all such exchanges had been made by the plaintiff's attorney, Thomas Hoke—the days, months, years and terms of payment all being duly entered in the registers. Accordingly he found the boy not guilty of what was surmised against him by his master, namely, that he had received so great a sum of money, for it was well known that Thpmas Haukere had no merchandise on that voyage to Middelburgh except a fardel of cloth which was not worth £20, and Thomas Hoke told the writer that he could not sell it for any sum of money so large as was alleged. Further, as to whether the boy made his journey by command of his master or of the attorney, or whether he was dead or alive or what had become of him, the writer could not gain any certainty or information from the inquiries he had made, but he knew that many English merchants, whom God assoil, had within the last two years been drowned and had lost their lives on the journey between England and Zeeland and in the straits of Holland. Accordingly, taking all these matters into consideration, he gave as his final award that the defendant, Edmund Olyver, be quit of all claims from the plaintiff, saving to the latter the right of proceeding against the boy, if, which God grant, he were still alive. The writer begged the Mayor and Aldermen not to be displeased by his delay in answering, which had been caused by a long wait at Orewell on his passage out and much business on his arrival at Middelburgh. [French] On receipt of this letter, the Mayor and Aldermen ordered the parties to be summoned for 2 July, on which day the plaintiff did not come and the defendant prayed that the award be enrolled."
Roll A 28: 1386-88,Membr. 11,1388/06/12,"Simon Broun, son of the late Robert Broun of London, was attached to answer John Bishop, mercer, and Katerine his wife, in a plea of contempt and trespass, in that he took service with the said Katerine, when she was sole, on 29 Dec. 1374 for seven years, receiving food and clothing as his wages, and left on 18 April 1375 without permission or reasonable cause, contrary to the ordinance (fn. 35) of the king and his council that any servant so leaving his service before the end of the contract should incur the penalty of imprisonment, whereby the plaintiff had damage £10. The defendant pleaded that long before 29 Dec. 1374 he became apprentice of a certain John Aunger, bottlemaker, for eight years, and that on that date his master sold the unexpired portion of his apprenticeship to the said Katerine without his consent (fn. 36) and gave her the counterpart of his indentures, which was against the custom of the city, since the plaintiff was not a freewoman either then or at any time during his apprenticeship and had no trade in the city, whereby he might be made a freeman, and the plaintiff, thus being seised of him as an apprentice by colour of the said sale, set him to minding horses outside the liberty of the city and gave him no instruction in his trade; and it was for this reason that he left her service, as he was entitled to do, for at no time did he make any covenant to serve her. He offered to verify his pleading and demanded judgment. The plaintiffs answered that the defendant of his own free will agreed to serve the said Katerine, which the defendant again denied, whereupon both parties put themselves on the country.

The Mayor and Aldermen, wishing to do justice between the parties, summoned the master before them.

She alleged that when her husband died without issue on Corpus Christi day (13 June) 1381 he possessed goods and chattels in the parish of St James Garlikhithe to the value of 3000 marks, viz. gold and silver in money, silver vessels, linen, woollen and silk cloth, wine in tuns, pepper, ginger and other merchandise. John Warde and Thomas Medelane making default, the defendant Gilbert appeared, after the great distress had been put upon him, and protested that he did not acknowledge the custom to be as alleged, or that the plaintiff was ever de jure the wife of Richard Lyons, or that the said Richard had any goods and chattels on the day of his death. He alleged that in 1363 before John Harald, commissary-official of the bishop of London, in St Paul's church the said Richard and Isabella, by the name of Isabella Pledour, were divorced at the suit of the said Richard on account of certain impediments, and such marriage as there was between them, so far as it went in fact, was declared annulled by definitive sentence. He demanded judgment whether the plaintiff could have any action against him. The plaintiff answered that she was married (desponsata) to the said Richard long before the time of the alleged divorce and that the marriage (sponsalia) continued till the death of her husband, and that at the Husting of Common Pleas on 13 Nov. 1385 she sued John Wakelee and Maud his wife on a writ of dower for the third part of two messuages and sixteen shops in London, which John and Maud afterwards alleged that her union with Richard Lyons was not lawful wedlock. To this she had replied that she was married at the door of St Mary de Stanynge church in Aldrichesgate. As the court then considered that the case belonged to ecclesiastical jurisdiction and they had no power to demand information from the bishop of London, and they wished to consult further, the action had been adjourned from Husting to Husting until 12 Nov. 1386, when the king sent a writ of certiorari, returnable to Chancery, demanding the record and process, and afterwards sent the return with another writ to the justices of the Bench (fn. 10) to deal with it. She had appeared before the justices and, on the default of the said John and Maud, prayed that a writ of certiorari be sent to the bishop. After several writs had been sent to him, the bishop at last sent to the justices his letters patent and close saying that he had summoned the parties before himself and his commissaries and, the matter having been thoroughly discussed, it had been found that Richard Lyons and Isabella Pledour had lawfully contracted matrimony, which was solemnised according to the accustomed form of the church. Afterwards the king sent his writs to Robert Bealknappe, justice of the Bench, and to Thomas Haxeye, keeper of the writs of the Bench, ordering them to send to Chancery their certificate with all matters connected, which certificate they duly sent. Thereupon the king sent the record and process with the certificate to the Husting on 27 April 1388 in order that they might proceed.

Finally on 10 May 1390 the king sent a writ, sub pede sigilli sui, reciting the proceedings and informing them that the record and process had been forwarded by Chancery to Robert Cherlton and other justices of the Bench, who had obtained from the bishop of London a certificate, dated 15 Nov. 1389, to the effect that the marriage contracted between Richard Lyons and Isabella Pledour had been quashed and annulled (fn. 11)."

The defendant in bar of action pleaded an agreement of 2 Nov. 1386 in the parish of St Gregory as regards all claims of the plaintiff against him, except a claim for the enrolment of a deed in Guildhall, which claim he did not acknowledge, and that in accordance with the agreement he paid the plaintiff 21 marks. The plaintiff answered that the agreement was made not in the parish of St Gregory but in that of St Mary Wolcherchehawe and that it was conditional on the defendant enrolling the deed of feoffment of the house, sealing indentures of a twenty years lease of the same and paying an old debt of 21 marks, which conditions, as regards the enrolment and the indentures, were not fulfilled. On these issues a jury of the two parishes of St Gregory and St Mary brought in a verdict that the agreement was made in the latter parish and was conditional, and they assessed damages at 5s.

Judgment was reserved until 5 April, when, the sheriff's serjeant having testified that the mainpernors had been warned, judgment was given that the plaintiff recover his damages as taxed by the jury.

Since the Mayor and Aldermen wished to be fully and completely informed, and since the more important men of the venue of Ludgate were either mainpernors of the defendant or belonged to his covin, they gave orders that 12 good men who were confined in Ludgate (fn. 17) at the time of the alleged trespass and were now at large should be summoned for 4 Dec.

Roll A 29: 1388-89,Membr. 8,1388/11/27,"Similar proceedings on a bill [French] of John Horlee of the parish of All Hallows Stanyng, who complained that when he was a prisoner for debt in Ludgate a year or more ago for 14 weeks, during which time he lay in his own clothes, borrowing no garments from any one else, some of his acquaintances gave the keeper the sum of 3s 4d for him, as the keeper himself admitted, and a certain Shalyngford also gave another 3s 4d, but the keeper not only retained these moneys but also charged him 3s for sleeping on the bare ground in the plaintiff's own bed and bed clothes, and demanded 8d more, taking a lined cloak (cloche double) from him as security, and then later, when the plaintiff, being delivered, went with his wife to ask humbly for the cloak and the alms due to him, the keeper suddenly leapt out on them and would have killed them with his drawn baselard, if they had not fallen on their knees and piteously begged for mercy. The same jury found the defendant not guilty of retaining the cloak, but said that the rest of the bill was true and assessed damages at 13s 4d. Judgment was given on 10 April 1389 that the plaintiff recover the above amount, but be in mercy for his false claim as regards the cloak."
Roll A 29: 1388-89,Membr. 8 b,1388/11/27,"Similar proceedings on a bill [French] of John Walpoll, tailor, formerly a prisoner in Ludgate, who complained that the keeper, John Bodesham, and his clerk, William Rounde, had ruled the prison extortionately and evilly, viz. when alms of 100s or 10 marks were received for the deliverance of poor and feeble prisoners, they put down in the calendar of deliveries the names of their own servants and the officers of the prison, who were at large, so that they might receive the alms, thus depriving the poor prisoners of their deliverance; and further, the common alms-box was shared out in the keeper's own chamber against the wishes of the prisoners, and he chose three or four prisoners, as he pleased, to share out the alms and do with them as they wished, whereas the box ought to be shared out in the presence of all the prisoners in their common room; and lately, when the prisoners had raised a great clamour against this unjust division of the alms, he had allowed them to divide the alms themselves, as was right and reasonable, but being angry because he could not have control of the box, he had forbidden the usual begging by two prisoners outside the prison of alms for the sustenance of the prisoners; and when the plaintiff prepared a bill of complaint to the mayor, containing all these matters, the officers of the prison delayed it for three weeks, so that when it reached the mayor, it found him too busy to deal with it; and then the keeper, to punish the plaintiff for his share of the bill, put him in the stocks and in irons for five weeks to the great damage of his legs and limbs, during which time, when a grant of 40s was made for his deliverance, the keeper heard of it and detained the money and by evil suggestion to the mayor had him transferred from Ludgate to Newgate, thus depriving him of his deliverance, and moreover he told charitable people that the plaintiff had been indicted, and he also detained his clothes and other things, of all of which matters and many others the plaintiff would inform the Mayor and Aldermen by word of mouth, if they would graciously listen to him. The same jury appeared on 4 Dec., when the plaintiff prayed leave to amend his bill, which the court refused. The jury then said on oath that the defendant was guilty of the bodily trespass against the plaintiff to his damage £30. Afterwards on 2 Feb. 1389 the plaintiff brought another bill [French], reciting the above proceedings and mentioning that his action had been abundantly affirmed by the verdict of the jury given in answer to questions by the court. On this occasion the plaintiff had submitted to the court that he was not learned in the law, and that his bill had been drawn up by lay persons and did not contain the day or year of the alleged trespass or the value of the goods detained or the amount of the damages, and he had prayed that his bill might be amended and that matters omitted might be inserted, in accordance with the advice of his counsel, as follows: the date of his imprisonment in Ludgate, 19 June 1388; the value of the goods, £10; and the damages, £60. The plaintiff again prayed that the bill might be amended, or alternately that the present bill might be put in the file and annexed to the former bill and record, and that judgment might be given. The sheriff's counsel and the counsel of the mainpernors prayed that the above bill might remain in court among other bills to which objection could be made. The court agreed. Process being continued, the plaintiff appeared on 10 April 1389 and prayed judgment. Whereupon, the record and process being heard, it appeared to the court that the original bill was defective for the reasons alleged by the plaintiff and for other reasons, that the bill was false in matter, since John Bodesham was not keeper of Ludgate during the mayoralty mentioned but had previously been relieved of his office, that the verdict of the jury had been taken inadvisedly, and that therefore judgment could not be rendered on that verdict, and further that by the custom of the city a bill in such a case could not be amended. Wherefore it was considered by the court that the bill be quashed and that the said John Walpole and his pledges be in mercy (fn. 18)."

Roll A 29: 1388-89,Membr. 11,1389/07/06,"John Costace, merchant of Gascony, demanded against John Forteneye, apprentice and attorney of John Mokkyng, merchant of London, the sum of £57 18s 4d due for 10 casks of Gascon wine at 110s 7d the cask, bought by the defendant at Sandwich on 9 Nov. 1388, which sum ought to have been paid on the quay late of Henry Picard in the parish of St Martin Vintry immediately the casks were put on shore, but though the casks were landed, gauged and filled, according to the agreement, the defendant refused to accept delivery or to pay the money. He demanded a remedy according to the custom of the city and the law merchant. The defendant admitted the agreement, but declared that the plaintiff was not prepared to deliver the casks as agreed, and on this issue he put himself on the country. Precept was given to summon a jury of whom one half should be Gascons, according to the custom. After making default, the jury appeared by distress on 16 July, when the parties agreed to put themselves on the arbitration of four men of the mistery of Vintners chosen by Robert Kerry, viz. William Sharpyng, Richard Patesle, Richard Lyttlyngton and Thomas Say, who were sworn. The jury were exonerated. As the said William Sharpyng had to leave town (devillare) on business, the arbitrators went next day to the mayor's house next to the church of St John Zakary, and announced their award in favour of the plaintiff, which award the mayor recited and recorded before the aldermen in court on the following Monday. The defendant was committed to prison until he should pay the sum due, after which the wine was to be delivered to him."
Roll A 29: 1388-89,Membr. 11 b,1389/07/06,"Afterwards the said John Forteneye brought a bill against his master, John Mokkyng, complaining that the latter had sent him to Sandwich with 13s 4d to buy the wine, which he did, sending word by a certain Robert Grey to his master, who approved of the bargain and assigned a portion of the wine to John Doget, and afterwards when the plaintiff returned to London, the master again said that he was content, but when the wine arrived in London, delivery was delayed for awhile owing to its being arrested by the sheriffs, after which the master refused to accept it. Since the bargain was not for his own but for his master's profit, he prayed a remedy. The matter having been thoroughly examined in accordance with the law merchant, it appeared to the court that the apprentice had bought the wine for the use and profit of his master, in which case the latter was bound to save him harmless. Accordingly it was considered that John Mokkyng pay £57 18s 4d to John Costace and that the apprentice be delivered from prison. As the master had not that sum ready he was committed to prison. An account being held, 51s 8d was deducted for gauging and other expenses, and on 20 March 1390 the defendant paid the residue. Information having been given to the mayor and chamberlain by Ralph de Cromwell, knight, lord of Tateshale (fn. 21), that a certain John Slory occupied a plot of waste ground annexed to his tenement in the parish of St Sepulchre without Newgate, claiming it as an appurtenance of his free tenement, whereas it was the soil and free tenement of the commonalty of the city (fn. 22) —the mayor and chamberlain ordered John Wykes, the serjeant of the Chamber, to summon an inquest of office from the neighbourhood to give a verdict. On 17 May 1389 a jury of Thomas Ermelyn and others were separately sworn to tell the truth. They said that at present they were not fully informed, but that certain good men of the neighbourhood, viz. Richard Storm, John Squyer, Henry Godchep, Richard Asshewell and Roger Totyng, were fully cognisant of the matter, and they prayed that they might be sworn to give them information. The above-named persons were summoned for the following Monday to be sworn and the jurors were ordered to attend on the plot of land on Thursday, when the informers would be there with them, so that they might give their verdict on 31 May. In addition Thomas Mallyng and Richard atte Chirche, masons, and Stephen Warde and William Endcote, carpenters, who were sworn to the city, were ordered to attend on Thursday to advise them, so that the law of the city might be observed in all things. The jurors with two of the informers duly appeared in the Chamber and declared that John Slory had met them on Thursday and had shown them deeds, which had been enrolled in the Husting, manifestly proving that he had certain messuages, houses and shops there, held from the king by service of 4d per annum, of which the plot in dispute was a parcel, and that the commonalty of the city had no title to the same. At the same time the masons and carpenters certified to the same effect."
Roll A 29: 1388-89,Membr. 12,1389/01/14,"Stephen Brunne, grocer, came before the Mayor and Aldermen and, in accordance with the custom of the city and the law merchant, brought a bill of complaint, as administrator of William Barkham, grocer, who died intestate, against John Beaufrount. The bill alleged that the plaintiff and William Barkham had entered into a bond dated 28 Oct. 1374 to pay the said John Beaufrount and a certain William de Lubenham the sum of £200. Afterwards on 4 Oct. 1375 in the parish of St Thomas the Apostle John Beaufrount agreed that if William Barkham would deliver to him cloth to the value of £200, taking in return a payment of £40, he would restore the bond and give him an acquittance. But though the cloth was delivered at Winchester, as witnessed by certificates under the mayoralty seal of Winchester, John Beaufrount had not returned the bond or fulfilled the conditions. [French] The defendant was summoned by John Harewell, the mayor's serjeant, and made default. Thereupon order was given to sequestrate him, by way of distress, by locking and sealing one door of his house, according to the custom of the city. On a second default another door was locked and sealed. On a third all the doors were locked and sealed. The defendant having failed to appear on a fourth summons, the plaintiff demanded judgment and damages, and in further proof of his action produced the following documents.

The king, thinking it not consonant with reason that, where an action was pending for judgment before the justices of the Bench, the matter of that action or anything touching it should be dealt with in an inferior court, ordered the Mayor and Aldermen to supersede proceedings on the bill of Stephen Brunne. Dated at Westminster 20 Jan. 1389. Afterwards on 8 July 1389 Stephen Brunne brought a writ of procedendo to the effect that John Beaufrount and William de Lubbenham had made default before the justices of the Bench, wherefore the Mayor and Aldermen were ordered to proceed. Dated 7 July 1389. Accordingly John Beaufrount was summoned to show cause why judgment should not be given, but did not come. It was considered that the plaintiff recover the bond. A jury of the venue of St Thomas the Apostle, where the abovementioned covenant was made, taxed the plaintiff's damages at £10. Thereupon the plaintiff alleged in full court that too small a sum for damages had been allowed, since he had spent more than £40 in the action, and he prayed that the sum for damages might be increased in accordance with custom and the law merchant. The Mayor and Aldermen raised the damages to a further 5 marks, and gave judgment for the return of the bond and the damages. The plaintiff prayed that the defendant be taken and committed to prison until he paid, which was granted under condition that if the defendant appeared within a year and a day to submit to justice, he should be admitted to answer."

Moreover the Mayor and Aldermen and their predecessors had been accustomed, from a time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, to take the oaths of such merchants and to examine them and put questions to them and to use other means of eliciting the truth, and then to terminate and bring to a final decision such bills and plaints pending before them according to their discretion and the truth discovered by examination, without any counsel or any other form of plea. This was the reason why the Mayor and Aldermen did not admit Francis de Conago to make his answer with his counsel on the matter specified in the writ, but caused him to answer by the law merchant by way of examination and other methods according to the ancient custom of the city, because he and his adversary were both merchants resident in the city and the matter of the bill exhibited entirely concerned merchandise."

The defendant, while protesting that he did not acknowledge that the plaintiff brought any boxes or that the goods were in the boxes or of the value alleged or that they were carried away, pleaded that long before the plaintiff entered the room or placed anything in it, he hired, by his servant John Shilyngton, a certain apartment (mansionem) from the defendant, viz. a hall, chamber, buttery and kitchen, at 6s 8d a week, on condition that neither the defendant nor his servants were to have anything to do with the said dwelling, or with the plaintiff or his servants, or with any goods brought in by them, and that the plaintiff was to buy his own victuals and other necessaries wherever he wished without interference by the defendant or his servants during his tenure of the apartment. By virtue of these conditions the plaintiff occupied the apartment until the day when the goods were alleged to have been carried away and long afterwards, during which time he bought his own necessaries outside the defendant's inn and the defendant and his servants did not interfere, nor did the defendant have any horse in his inn or buy any food for the plaintiff, nor did the plaintiff in any manner lodge with him, nor did any goods of the plaintiff come in any way into his custody, as he was prepared to verify, without that etc. He demanded judgment whether the plaintiff could impute any default of custody to him, and whether the plaintiff ought to have any ground of action against him for the loss of his goods.

He prayed the Mayor and Aldermen to have the balance and weights brought into court, so that they might discuss whether they were forfeitable or not. [French] The defendant appeared on summons on 18 Feb. and pleaded that the plaintiff had no ground of action against him, because from time immemorial all balances, used by persons weighing lead between merchant and merchant, which were not sealed with the seal of the city, were forfeitable to the use of the sheriffs and went towards the payment of the king's farm. Further the present sheriffs had committed the weighing of lead to the defendant in virtue of their office. The plaintiff having weighed lead with balance and weights which were not sealed, the sheriffs had arrested them as forfeitable and sold them to the defendant, who was in possession of them for that reason; without that (fn. 3) he was an official of the sheriffs or by colour of his office had arrested them, as the plaintiff supposed by his bill.

The other defendant, John Tervyn, pleaded that the bill was insufficient in law, because it did not mention or allege that the Duke de Berry had failed to pay the money due before Easter. The plaintiff answered that there was sufficient matter in the bill to maintain his action and that the other defendant, Nicholas, had acknowledged the truth of it. He prayed judgment. The action was adjourned until 10 Dec. in order that the court might be advised according to the law merchant and the custom of the city.

The said Robert came to him in the parish of St Mary at Hill and said that he knew where the tuns of woad were and that on these tuns 8 marks were due to a certain John Pycard and 23s 8d to himself, but the woad was worth more than this, and if the plaintiff would pay him the amounts mentioned, he might have the tuns. Accordingly he paid the said Robert; whereas the truth was that Robert had nothing to do with the woad, and the only amount due on it was 8s to John Pycard for cellarage. [French] The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff came to his wharf next to the Wolkeye in the parish of St Dunstan in the East, and walked up and down, sighing and wailing (suspirando et ululando); so he asked him why he had come and what he was looking for. The plaintiff answered that he was given to understand that Bartholomew Berford had 4 tuns of woad in a house on the wharf, but he did not know which house. He told the plaintiff that there were 4 tuns in John Pycard's house, but to whom they belonged he did not know. Thereupon the plaintiff asked him to go to Pycard to make inquiries, which he did, learning that they belonged to Bartholomew Berford and had been pledged to Pycard by a certain Mark Hunt for 10 marks 7 shillings, in connection with some debt or other. The plaintiff then gave him this amount and asked him to pay Pycard, which he did the same day, whereupon the plaintiff received delivery of the tuns. He prayed judgment whether the plaintiff ought to have any action against him. The plaintiff repeated that the defendant was guilty of deceit and put himself on the country. A jury of the venue, consisting of William Bastard, Hugh Roos, John Dromayn and others, related the facts (fn. 18) in the same manner as the defendant had done, and said he was not guilty of any deception. Judgment that he be acquitted of the bill and that the plaintiff take nothing and be in mercy."

The plaintiff alleged that a certain John Bradfeld, grocer, owed the said John Strowsburgh the sum of £60, and that on 12 March 1388 the defendant took the debt upon himself, of which a portion was paid in John Strowsburgh's lifetime, leaving the above sum in arrears.

Accordingly it was considered, for the above reasons and because the master was living outside the liberties and was rebellious towards the mayor's serjeant, that the apprentice be exonerated from his indentures."

The plaintiff remained a : Cyvyle in the river with the barge and 40 sailors for ten weeks beyond the four weeks mentioned, because the merchants did not load their cargo, and he arrived at Hampton on 30 June 1392, where part of the cargo was delivered to the said Tyrame and George, and finally came to London on 12 Aug. where he delivered the rest of the cargo to them. By the law merchant he was entitled to 675 francs for freight, 25 francs for shoe-money, and 300 doubles penalty for delay, but though he had demanded these sums from the merchants, they refused to pay, to his damage £1000. [French] The plaintiff found pledges for prosecution, viz.

As regards 500 francs of that amount they prayed judgment as to whether they were liable to the plaintiff twice over, and as regards 200 francs they pleaded that the said Octobone and Pelegrin had lent that sum to the plaintiff at Civile on 1 March 1392 for the provisioning of the barge and crew, on condition that he should repay it at the port where the cargo was discharged, as soon as he received satisfaction for the freight, under penalty of one franc each day for delay. In proof of this plea they submitted a deed [French] of the plaintiff, admitting receipt of 200 francs from Octobone Grelo and Pelegryn Caitaneo, which he promised to repay without taking advantage of any exception of the law or any royal protection, and giving the justices, judges and bailiffs of all ports in any country power to levy the money, if unpaid, on the barge and its gear. The defendants pleaded that since the money due for the freight was then in the hands of the sheriffs, they had complied with the conditions of their charter and they prayed for the return of 200 francs in accordance with the above deed. As regards the claim for 300 doubles they pleaded that the plaintiff could not maintain his action against them, since they agreed to load the barge within four weeks at Civile and the plaintiff agreed to cross to St Luke de Barameda to receive cargo, and the said Octobone and Pelegrin had fulfilled all the conditions in their charter (fn. 6), which they produced:"

It was agreed that the merchants provide a pilot from Civile and that they caulk the cabin of the barge (fn. 7), and that the master was bound to provide the barge well equipped and found with sailors and all its gear, and that he should have a boat and cocket fitted for taking and discharging cargo in any port in which they tarried, paying the boat-crews their right, and that he should provide the merchants with fresh water, salt, firewood and cressets burning fore and aft, while towage (fn. 8) and little pilotages were to be a charge upon the goods of the merchants, and whatsoever should be found of the gift of God in fresh or salt water should be divided, one part for the merchants, one for the barge and the third for the master, and further the master and sailors should defend the merchants and their goods against all men except those of the master's own country. Either party not keeping the terms of the charters must pay the other the sum of 300 doubles Moreskes dor (fn. 9), chargeable on the barge or the merchants' goods as the case might be. [French] The plaintiff pleaded that as regards 500 francs of the 700 francs, the defendants had said nothing to acquit themselves, and as regards the 200 francs which they alleged had been lent to him he was not bound by law to answer them, and as regards the 300 doubles penalty mentioned in his charter he was prepared to verify his plea. And the defendants pleaded as before, refusing to accept the plaintiff's charter. The court asked for information from the sheriffs as to the actions for debt against the plaintiff and learnt that all except that of Amfrion Bekevile for £21 2s 6d were pending unsettled without a day owing to the king's letters of protection to the plaintiff. Accordingly it was considered that the plaintiff recover 675 francs for freight, 25 francs shoemoney and 20s damages, less the amount claimed by the said Amfrion, together with 300 doubles penalty, and that the sheriff deliver to him 700 francs, less the amount claimed by Amfrion."

Roll A 32: 1392-93,Membr. 5,1392/11/05,"Thomas Pynchon, an, orphan of the city, son of John Pynchon, late citizen and jeweller, brought a bill before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber against Robert Excestre, prior of the church of Crichirche, London, William Cressewyk, William Baret, Hugh Sprot, Walter Pynchon and John Edmond, executors of the will of his father, for detaining his third part of the goods and chattels and debts owed to his father on the day of his death, contrary to the custom of the city, by which an only child, who had not been advanced, was entitled to a third part. The said orphan alleged that he was the only child of his father and Margaret his wife, and that his father died on 24 Sept. 1392, leaving goods and chattels of the value of £2200 and debts owed to him of the value of £1000 and 100 marks. [French] Robert Peek, common pleader of the city (fn. 20), prosecuted on behalf of the orphan. The defendants, by Philip Rykhalle their attorney, while not admitting that the testator left goods of the value named, pleaded that they had paid over £300 debts owed by him, that he made certain bequests in his will, that the funeral cost over 200 marks, in addition to other expenses, that the testator on the death of his first wife married Idonea, leaving no issue by her, and that where a man died leaving a wife without issue by her, there was no custom in the city that the issue of a previous wife, even though he had not been advanced, should have the third part of the goods and chattels of his father (fn. 21). The plaintiff answered that it was immemorial custom that such a son should have a third part on the death of his father, even though the latter left a widow without issue. As the court was not fully advised as to this custom, or how such a custom ought to be tried (triari), the action was adjourned from day to day until 3 July 1393, when the parties appeared. But since there was great doubt and difference of opinion among the Mayor and Aldermen as to the custom of the city, the action was again adjourned, and these differences continued, retarding the execution of the will, until the executors produced the will, in which a clause stated that the testator wished the orphan to be remunerated (remuneraretur) from the goods and chattels after the legacies had been paid. In order to fulfil the will and for the sake of peace, the executors offered the plaintiff the sum of £600 as his ""remuneration,"" if approved by the court, in full satisfaction of his claims, under the condition that if he died under the age of sixteen years, the money should be returned to the executors, to be treated by them as the money of the testator and expended for the good of the testator's soul. They stated that this sum was a third of the testator's goods and chattels, omitting certain debts owed to him by magnates, which might be regarded as desperate debts. Thereupon the will was read in court, and since the testator willed that all feoffees of his lands and tenements should enfeoff the plaintiff therewith, such lands being of great value, and thus the orphan had in a manner been advanced at his father's death, the court asked whether the orphan and his friends would be satisfied with this offer by way of ""remuneration,"" according to the form of the will. The plaintiff, with the consent of the court and by the advice of the Mayor and Aldermen as guardians of the orphans of the city, and also with the consent of Richard Felde, the king's clerk, and Walter Pynchon his uncle, in the presence of John Markham, Hugh Holes, William Gascoigne and John Woderove, serjeants-at-law, and Thomas Skelton and William Skrene, his counsel, accepted the offer. Accordingly it was considered that the orphan be content with the above sum and take nothing by his bill and be precluded from his action, and that the executors be quit thereof, and that, as the plaintiff was an orphan, his amercement be condoned."

This sum the defendant refused to pay. The defendant, by William Sydyngbourne his attorney, pleaded that by the custom of the city from time out of mind the sheriffs had been accustomed in their compters to receive and enter plaints of debt, account, trespass and other contracts and that when a defendant was committed to prison for debt and the plaintiff afterwards acknowledged satisfaction and demanded the defendant's release, the sheriffs were used to release such a debtor, and whereas the plaintiff came to the sheriffs' compter in the parish of St Mildred by the Stocks (fn. 24) and acknowledged satisfaction, the debtor was released, and accordingly he prayed judgment whether the plaintiff could maintain his action against him.

Roll A 33: 1393-94,Membr. 2,1393/12/04,"Philip Vale, merchant of Bristol, who had married an orphan of the city, Eleanour, daughter of Richard Toky, grocer, deceased, brought a bill before the Mayor and Aldermen praying that William Bys, John Olney and William Pountfreit, executors of the will of the said Richard, give account of certain tenements and rents of the value of 1000 marks, devised to them by the testator to be sold and the proceeds divided equally between Richard, William, John, Maude and Eleanour, children of the said Richard, and also of the goods and chattels of the testator, which were of the value of £100. According to the will, if any child died under age, his or her share should be divided between the survivors. Since then, the children William and John had died. [French] Robert Pek, the common pleader, affirmed the matter contained in the bill on behalf of the orphans, Eleanour, Richard and Maude. The defendant William Bys, by Philip Rykhall his attorney, did not acknowledge that the goods and chattels were of the value alleged and, as regards the lands and tenements, pleaded that the custom from time out of mind was as follows: that every freeman and freewoman of the city could devise his tenements within the city to his executors to be sold as movable chattels, and if his movable chattels did not suffice to pay his debts, the executors from the money received from the sale of the tenements were charged to pay his debts, in the same manner as they would from his goods and chattels. They pleaded further that the tenements were sold to a certain John Sandhurst for £322 8s 4d, that the children Richard and Maude were under age, and that Eleanour on 6 June 1393, being of full age, married the plaintiff Philip Vale against the executors' wishes. They had paid to him the share due to his wife and had received from him an acquittance, produced in court, as follows: Acquittance from Philip Vale for his wife's portion of her father's goods and chattels, as set forth in an inventory, and also for her portion of £322 6s 8d coming from the sale of tenements, saving the right to claim a further share, if any of the children died or took the religious habit under age, a share of any debts still unpaid to the executors, and a share of any portion of £19 2s 9d, reserved for paying the testator's debts, which might be unexpended. Dated at London 6 Aug. 1393. The defendant further pleaded that the goods and chattels at no time amounted to more than £57 9s 1d, and that the testator was indebted to divers persons in the sum of £137 6s 11d, as appeared by the following inventory: Inventory of the goods and chattels of Richard Toky, deceased, made on 26 Oct. 1391 by Geoffrey Baldok, upholder, Richard Lygthfelow, brasier, John Borham, stockfishmonger, Thomas Panton and Philip Wynter, goldsmiths, Stephen Verderne, skinner, John Page and Roger Couton, armourers, and Richard Mymmes, joiner."

[French] A day having been given to the parties on 20 May, the said Philip Vannoche also appeared and brought a bill of complaint against the same defendant for detinue of the same bond, which he alleged had been entrusted to her on 5 Aug. 1394 in the parish of St Peter Cornhull. [Latin] The defendant pleaded that the bond had been entrusted to her by consent of the parties on condition that she should return it to the plaintiff Philip if he should deliver to the said Elizabeth within three days a set (sectam sive sortam) of pearls of the value of £10, other sets of the value of £20, £15 and £30, and one of large pearls valued at £70, a tally for £100 and a fictitious (fictam) bond for £100, wherein the said Philip claimed that Elizabeth was bound to him, a bond of 100 marks wherein Philip and Elizabeth were bound to one Guyno, a Lombard, linen and woollen cloths and a saddle of the value of £20, all of which had been entrusted to the said Philip by the said Elizabeth. If Philip failed to return the above-mentioned goods, the bond was to be given to John and Elizabeth. As she, the defendant, did not know whether these conditions had been fulfilled or not, she prayed that John and Elizabeth should show cause why she should not deliver the bond to Philip, and that the prosecuting parties should interplead, and thereupon she produced the bond in court. Interpleader being granted by the court, John Billyng and Elizabeth Beauchamp, by their attorney Philip Rykhall, pleaded that the bond had been delivered to the said Amy under the conditions mentioned by her, and that they had not received the goods, wherefore they demanded judgment and damages against Philip Vannoche. Philip Vannoche, by John Roo his attorney, pleaded that John and Elizabeth had delivered the bond to him and he had entrusted it to Amy for return when required without any conditions, and he offered to verify this against Amy. The latter, on the ground that John and Elizabeth had been summoned to interplead with Philip, claimed that by law she had no need to admit Philip to verify his plea. The said Philip was then repeatedly asked by the Mayor and Aldermen whether he would answer the plea of John and Elizabeth, and refused to do so, still claiming damages against Amy. After an adjournment for consultation, it was considered that John and Elizabeth should recover the bond, with damages against Philip taxed at 40s. Order was given to distrain Amy to produce the bond and that Philip be committed to prison till he paid the damages. The bond was produced and handed over to John and Elizabeth on 13 Dec. 1397."

[French] The defendant was arrested by Richard Jardevill and appeared in court on 26 March, when he denied the force and injury and the destruction and taking away of goods and chattels and thereon he put himself on the country. As regards entering the house he pleaded that the plaintiff was an innkeeper and the house was a common inn and that he entered it as a lodger, and he prayed judgment as to whether the plaintiff had any action against him. The plaintiff denied that his house was a common inn and said that long before 24 March 1394 he had forbidden the defendant to enter his house, because he suspected his relations with his wife. The parties went to a jury on the issue whether the house was a common inn and whether the defendant had been forbidden entry. A jury of the venue brought in a verdict that the defendant entered the house against the plaintiff's prohibition and damaged and spoilt his goods to the plaintiff's damage 25 marks (fn. 94), but as regards carrying away the goods alleged, they found the defendant not guilty. Therefore it was considered that the plaintiff recover the damages taxed by the jury and that the defendant be committed to prison till he paid the damages and also a fine to the king for his trespass, but that the plaintiff be in mercy for his false claim about the carrying away of goods."

Burton, merchants of London. On the death of the intestate by shipwreck, the plaintiff has been forced to pay this sum at Middelburgh by the law of the Staple of Middelburgh, and he now claimed it from the administrator.

Cambridge, for payment in the Sheriffs' Court. He produced the record of the action, which showed that on Thomas atte More's making default, he had been awarded the right of collecting a number of debts owed to the intestate and also, as a foreign attachment, a quantity of goods belonging to the intestate, which were then in his (the present defendant's) custody. These goods were valued in the Sheriffs' Court by John Cosham and Thomas Merton, mercer, as follows: 82 lbs. of brasile (fn. 4) at 3s. the lb.; 9 pieces of red bukeram at 3s the piece; 20 groos of gold of Lucca (fn. 5), 10s; 33,000 chestnuts (castons) at 16d the thousand; 7000 small white plates (fn. 6) at 8s the thousand; 211 lbs. of coperwire at 4d the lb.; one long sword, 6s 8d; one cappe of bevere, 2s 6d; one box of cipres, 8d; an old basynett with visere, 4s; 4 pieces of bokasyns of barbarie (fn. 7) at 18s the piece.

The parties submitted to the arbitration of William Brampton, Thomas Aleyn, John Shaddeworth, Hugh Clerk, William Parker, John More, William Marchesforth and William Sonnyngwell, who awarded that, as the goods and debts exceeded the debt of £100 by 100 marks, the defendant should pay the plaintiff the latter sum and also supply him with a list of the names of certain persons who owed money to the intestate, and that both parties should quitclaim to each other all actions; which was done.

[French] The defendants appeared after three defaults and pleaded that all sheriffs had the power of choosing deputies to guard the gaol and the prisoners, that they had appointed a certain William Popelton and others, who were dwelling in the city and had sufficient goods and chattels to satisfy the plaintiff's claim, and that action lay against the latter and not against the sheriffs themselves.

The defendant denied that there was any such condition as to payment or that they submitted themselves unconditionally to the arbitration, and said that the parties agreed that if either of them refused to accept the award, he should be bound to the masters and mistery of Mercers in £20, and since he had refused the award, he was liable only for that amount.

They pleaded that the bonds were handed to them to be given up under certain conditions, and since they did not know whether the conditions had been fulfilled; they asked that Thomas Lydyard be summoned. The said Thomas appeared and pleaded that a dispute between himself and the plaintiff about a house in Oxford had been submitted to the arbitration of John More, John Sutton, grocer, Richard Northbury and Thomas Prudance, mercers, who awarded that Edmund Fraunceys should enfeoff him with the house within six days and levy a fine in the king's court in order to debar any claim of Edmund's wife Agnes on the ground of dower, for which he was to pay Edmund a rent of £10 for life, and thereupon they had deposited bonds for £100 to be delivered to one party if the other failed to fulfil the award. The said Edmund, he pleaded, had not made the feoffment. The plaintiff denied that there was any condition of making a feoffment, and as regards the fine, he said that he and his wife had fulfilled the award, but that the said Thomas had not given him security for paying the rent.

The sheriffs' serjeant was ordered, according to custom, to summon the said John and Margaret for the next court of the king, to wit, Wednesday 13 March, on which day the said John came. The sheriffs' serjeant testified that he had summoned the said John and Margaret. Thereupon the court ordered the said John to bring his wife to answer with him according to the custom of the city. Both defendants appearing on 15 March, the plaintiff made his declaration, in which he complained that the late Roger Crane was found to be in arrears to him in the sum of £32 by an account made before John Broun, auditor, on 28 Aug. 1394, which sum the said Margaret his executrix refused to pay, to his damage £20."
Roll A 37: 1397-98,Membr. 3 b,1398/03/11,"Upon this, in accordance with the custom whereby the Mayor and Aldermen at their pleasure could cause a plea pending in the Sheriffs' Court to come before them at the request of either party and could terminate it after examination of the parties, or in any other due manner according to the law merchant and the custom of the city, Richard Whityngton, mayor, instructed his serjeant to order the sheriff to bring the plea before him and to warn the parties to appear the same day, which was done. The said William Crane and John Barker appeared in person and the said Margaret by John Barker as her attorney. A day was given to them, by their consent, on Friday 22 March, when the parties appeared. The mayor then asked the defendants whether, if the plaintiff together with John Broun and John Deux would swear that the said John Broun heard the account and that the sum of £32 was due, they would be willing to be condemned in £32 according to the law merchant and the custom of the city and to be committed to prison. The defendants peremptorily agreed, and the plaintiff for his part agreed to be excluded from his action if he and the said John Broun and John Dreux were unwilling to swear. Thereupon the plaintiff, John Broun and John Dreux being examined, swore as abovesaid. And because it is and has been the custom of the city of London from a time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, that when the defendant in any bills or plaints before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber of the Guildhall or before either of the Sheriffs is willing to put himself peremptorily on the oath of the plaintiff that the matter contained in the bill or count is true, if the plaintiff is unwilling so to swear, he ought by the law merchant and the custom of the city to be excluded from his action and demand, but if he so swears, the defendant ought to be condemned in the plaintiff's action and demand, and because it is also the custom that when the defendant offers to put himself peremptorily on the oath of the plaintiff and other good men with him (fn. 4), as upon the oath of the plaintiff alone upon any point, matter or thing contained in such bill or count, the same consequences ensue—therefore it was considered that the plaintiff recover against the defendants the said sum of £32. The plaintiff remitted the damages. The defendant John Barker, being present in court, was committed to Ludgate until he paid. Writ of certiorari, dated at Westminster 2 Aug. 1398, demanding the record and process of the plea between William Crane, haberdasher, and John Barker and Margaret his wife, executrix of Roger Crane."

[French] As the plaintiff was under age, the court appointed John Dalton to prosecute her bill. The defendants having made three defaults, John Middelton appeared alone on 4 June, when he appointed Lambert Frampton his attorney and was mainprised for his appearance on 9 June."
Roll A 38: 1398-99,Membr. 4 b,1399/05/10,"On that day the said John Middelton prayed judgment as to whether the court had any cognisance of the matter in the bill, which dealt with testamentary dispositions, the cognisance of which belonged to the Court Christian. Notwithstanding this exception to its jurisdiction, the court ordered him to plead further. He then pleaded that on 16 Sept. 1396, when he was alleged to have forged a will, the testator having died, the testator was in fact alive at Lavendene (fn. 6) co. Bucks and for two days after. He prayed that the bill be quashed. He was ordered to plead furtner, notwithstanding this exception to the bill. Thereupon the defendant, while not admitting any embezzlement of the first will or forging of the second, declared that he would make his plea as follows—it was true that John Olneye had devised the sum of £40 to the plaintiff on 10 Aug. but afterwards on 1 Sept., believing that he could not fulfil the legacies, the testator changed his will and made another one at Lavendene, revoking the former will, which second will the defendant now produced in court, and that afterwards the testator died, when his will was proved according to ecclesiastical law before the ordinary in that county, and was duly administered, and this was the will which the plaintiff alleged to be a forgery, which he was prepared to verify etc. The plaintiff, while protesting that she did not admit anything pleaded by the defendant, chose as her plea the statements made in her declaration, which she was prepared to verify. She demanded judgment whether she was bound by law to answer the defendant's allegations."
Roll A 38: 1398-99,Membr. 5,1399/05/10,"As the court wished to consult more fully as to rendering of judgment, a day was given on the quindene of St Michael, before which day the action remained without a day because the lord Richard, late king of England, dismissed himself from the rule of his kingdom (fn. 7). The plaintiff appeared on the quindene and prayed that the parties should be summoned to hear judgment on the 22 Oct. After several adjournments, and Richard Blomville having died, the parties appeared on 21 Jan., when the court, wishing for information as to the amount of damages to be adjudged in case judgment were given against the defendant, ordered a jury of the parish of St Michael Crokydlane to be summoned for 18 Feb. The jury said on oath that the plaintiff sustained damages, by reason of the deception alleged in her bill, if judgment were given for her, to the value of £55. And since it seemed to the court that the matter alleged by the defendant was not sufficient in law, according to the custom of the city, to exclude the plaintiff from her action, it was considered that she recover against the said John Middelton and his mainpernors the sum of £55 taxed by the jury. And upon this, the plaintiff, by her guardian, acknowledged that she did not wish to prosecute her bill further against John Olneye, junior. Accordingly it was ordered that she have execution against John Middelton and his mainpernors, and on her request, precept was issued to take and detain them in prison until the money be paid."

The plaint, beginning with the words: ""Plaint levied in the house of John Wade, one of the sheriffs of London, on Thursday 10 July 1399,"" was produced, and the plaintiff John Tervyn then made his count, in which he alleged that on 13 Feb. 1392 the defendant Amy Donat took and carried away by force and arms the sum of £20, belonging to John Donat and then in the custody of the plaintiff, against the peace and to his damage £40. The defendant found mainprise for her appearance to answer the count on 22 Oct., the plea remaining without a day during the interval, because the lord Richard, late king of England, had dismissed himself from the rule of his kingdom. On 22 Oct., at the request of the plaintiff, precept was issued to re-attach the defendant for her appearance on 27 Oct. The plaintiff having declared as before, she pleaded not guilty. A jury of the parish of St Helen Bishopsgate on 3 Dec. prayed for a week's interval before giving their verdict, and on 10 Dec. found her guilty and taxed damages at £21.

Item, William Vaux, attorney of the defendant Joan, had stated that Bartholomew de Bosano, coming from Scotland in the king's company, had fallen sick at Newark and made his will, appointing as his executors Joan his wife, John Duffeld, John Corne and John Bilte, who administered his goods and chattels after his death, and as these persons were not named in the plaint, he demanded judgment, whereupon the plaintiff had denied that John Duffeld and the others were executors and had challenged the defendant, in accordance with the custom of the city, to an oath that her pleading was true, to which William Vaux had replied that the defendant Joan was not bound to answer as regards the alleged custom, but that he, as her attorney, would take the oath, and the court, not allowing his exceptions, had ordered him to continue pleading.  Item, the plaint was levied against the said Joan and her co-executors in common, and as the co-executors did not appear, she prayed judgment whether she need answer without them, and the court had not allowed her exception and had ordered her to answer further.  Item, though the plaintiff made his declaration against the defendant Joan only, in the absence of her co-executors, on the supposition that this action was sufficient, nevertheless he prosecuted process of capias against the co-executors to answer together with her, thus waiving and renouncing the advantage conferred on him by statute (fn. 1), whereupon she prayed judgment whether the court wished to call on her to answer before the appearance of her co-executors, and notwithstanding this exception, the court ordered her to answer further.  Item, when her co-executor William Sowthows appeared by his attorneys Richard Legge and William Rokesburgh, and pleaded that the testator, falling sick at Newark, appointed him, together with John Duffeld, John Corne, John Bilte and John Taillour as executors, and the names of these executors were not named in the plaint, whereof he prayed judgment, notwithstanding this exception the court ordered him to answer further.  Item, during the process divers precepts were issued and there were continuations of the action by putting the jury in respite, and judgment was deferred that the court might consult.  Item, judgment having been rendered for Thomas Aleyn, the plaintiff, execution of the judgment was made against the defendant Joan.

After three defaults the defendant appeared on 27 June and appointed John Hethyngham his attorney to answer the plaintiff. Next day, by his attorney, he protested that he did not acknowledge that the tin was of the value named, and pleaded, as his plea, that the plaintiff ought not to have an action against him, because the purchase by William Venour took place in the parish of St Mary Wolnoth and the said William Venour undertook to find other sufficient persons to enter into bonds with him for the payment of £150, after which the tin was to be delivered, but had failed to do so. He prayed that the matter be inquired into by a jury, of whom one half should be of the plaintiff's language, namely Florentines. The plaintiff pleaded that the facts were as set forth in his bill and likewise prayed a jury.

As it seemed to the court that too little was allowed for expenses, judgment was given that the plaintiff recover the tin, if possible, together with the aforesaid damages and another 100s for his expenses, or otherwise the price of the tin together with damages as aforesaid."

The plaintiff pleaded that he ought not to be admitted to his law, because it was immemorial custom in the city that if any person acknowledged himself to be debtor to another person in any sum before any alderman (fn. 11), and the creditor afterwards sued him for the amount, the debtor ought not to be admitted to his law, and the defendant had acknowledged that he was debtor of 59s 11d in the presence of William Crowmere, then and now alderman, which he was ready to verify. The defendant denied that he had acknowledged owing 59s 11d and put himself on the record of William Crowmere, praying the court that the said William might be examined. The plaintiff did likewise.

The defendant offered to pay the whole or as much as the plaintiff demanded, if it could be legally proved that he ever had or administered any goods, chattels or rents of the testator, and he offered to produce authentic letters under the seal of the city of Coventry. The plaintiff agreed to be precluded from his action, if he produced such letters.
