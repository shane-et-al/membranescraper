Roll A 1a: April 1323 - Aug 1326,Membrane 1,No date,"Letter from the Mayor to the Earl of Kent, acknowledging his request of 20 Jan. for a force of 50 arbalesters for service against the Castle of Wallingford (fn. 1), which was then held by rebels. The matter had been laid before the Commonalty, who replied that it was impossible to raise the men, because the citizens had undertaken to hold the City for the King, as surety for which the Queen and her children were dwelling in London, and the duty of guarding the City against sudden surprise, as well as losses by piracy at sea, had greatly impoverished the citizens. (F)"
Roll A 1a: April 1323 - Aug 1326,Membrane 1,1323/04/06,"The King's writ (fn. 2) to the Mayor and Sheriffs, to the effect that the people of middle condition in the City [mediocris populi] had complained of interference by the Mayor and Sheriffs with their ancient right of selling small wares at the head of Cheap in the evening, whereby their livelihood was taken from them.

Roll A 1a: April 1323 - Aug 1326,Membrane 1,1323/07/28,"Further writ with regard to sales during the evening hours at Cornhill. A presentment had been made before Hervey de Staunton and the other Itinerant Justices at the Tower that Simon Ricongey and others had sold old clothes, shoes and other goods by night at Cornhill in deception of the people, although such sales were lawful only between sunrise and noon, and judgment had been given that in future these goods should not be exposed for sale after vespers struck at the Church of St Thomas the Martyr of Acon. Owing to subsequent complaints, the Mayor and Aldermen had been several times ordered to proceed against offenders, but had been remiss in levying the fines due from them to the King, on the ground that these writs had been obtained by John Waldeshef (fn. 3) against the liberty of the City, to which jurisdiction in this matter and the fines arising therefrom were claimed to belong. Moreover the above John, although he had no part in obtaining the writs, had been removed from the counsel of the City, forbidden to practise in the Courts, and deprived of the pension which he had enjoyed. Accordingly the Mayor and Aldermen are commanded to revoke their measures against him, and to collect the fines due to the King without delay, any question as to the latter being reserved for the consideration of the King's Court.

The writers report that on Stratford's arrival in London they had seized nineteen Bulls, of which five were patent and three close. The Bishop had forbidden them to look at these Bulls, because they related to the King's private affairs, which he had in charge. Accordingly they had forwarded them to the King under their seals. Nine other Bulls Close were directed on the covers to the Queen, the Prelates and other magnates of the realm. These also had been sealed and would be delivered to the King by a serjeant. (F)"

For this purpose weights, balances and weighing-houses had been provided, for the upkeep of which a toll of one halfpenny on each quarter weighed had been imposed. By a subsequent writ, Edw. I had confirmed these ordinances. Recently, however, the bakers and millers had sued before Geoffrey le Scrope and his fellow-Justices for the abolition of the toll and pesage.

In answer to previous letters, the Mayor etc. of Northampton had declared that the wine had been taken without payment from the above Philip by the Earl Marshal at the tournament in Northampton, that Philip would pay anything due as soon as account had been rendered between himself and John, and that the authorities of Northampton could not force a man to pay a debt except by process of law. The writers now wish to point out that Philip had acknowledged the debt, which was further witnessed by a tally for 16 marks, of which 20s had been paid, so that no further rendering of account was necessary. As for the plea that the burgesses of Northampton were bound by the common law not to distrain for a debt except by process of law, the writers would have them know that the citizens of London were entitled by their franchises (fn. 7) to take distresses from the fellow-citizens or fellow-burgesses of debtors. Accordingly once more they desire the authorities of Northampton to take steps against the above Philip, who was a fellow-burgess of theirs and under their jurisdiction. (F)"

The writers understood that the City believed, on the strength of a letter from the Mayor of York, that Richard Betoyne (fn. 31) had advocated the removal of the Staple abroad, and claimed by a charter the office of Mayor of the Staple overseas. They wish to testify that the said Richard attended an assembly of the ""Commune"" of merchants in the Chapter House at York, at which the writers and Richard de Edelmeton, William atte Pole and other merchants from 28 towns were present, when they discussed the Staple, as they were instructed to do by the Chancellor. The merchants had put it to Richard de Betoyne that he was their Mayor and he had denied it (susmistrent au dit Richard de Bettoyne estre lour metre et il respoundit qe noun), whereupon they answered him that he ought to go and lay down his mayoralty in the place where he took it up, and surrender the charters, which had cost them dear. To this he replied that John de Charletone (fn. 32) had the charter of their franchises and detained it, but that he had himself, four years ago, caused a transcript to be made, which he was ready to surrender if they wished. At this point, the Mayor of York suddenly appeared, hand in hand with John de Charletone, with three or four others of their party and several members of the Commune of York, on which Richard de Betoyne said he would not stay in any place where John de Charletone was taken into counsel, and he got up and left and did not return to the Council of the merchants. For this reason Richard de Edelmeton and the rest were angry with him. This was all that happened, and the writers have no knowledge of any misconduct on the part of Richard de Betoyne, and are grieved that stories to his discredit should have been reported by the Mayor of York. On the contrary they had found the said Richard always zealous to carry out the wishes of the City. As regards news, they report the arrival of the French envoys, who had not given any answer. The Scottish envoys were on the way, and the Council was sitting daily to promote an agreement among the magnates. Letters had come to the King and Queen, announcing the death of the King of France.

He had only been in the company of the merchants at York on one occasion, when they put it to him that he was Mayor of the Staple (mistrent sur que ieo fu meire de les Estaples) and wished to have counsel with him, and he had answered that he did not consider himself their Mayor, and had not come to counsel them, but that John de Graham (fn. 33) and John Priour were present, in accordance with the writs, to deal with the matter of the Staple. The merchants then charged him by the oath he had taken overseas that he should go abroad and lay down his mayoralty in the place where he had received it, together with their charters and muniments, which had cost them dear. He had replied that he had left the charters on the other side of the sea with their other things on his departure thence, except their charter of the franchises of the Staples, purchased from the late King, which was in the hands of John de Charleton, who detained it, but he had had a copy made at Dover in the 18th year of King Edward, the King's father, when the latter was at that place; and he offered it to the merchants. He encloses a copy for the information of the City of London. As a proof of the ill-will entertained towards him by the men of York, he mentions that the Mayor of York appeared maliciously and without warning, with four or five of his livery, and led in his enemy, John de Charletone, dressed in their livery as a burgess of York, and with them were a great many of the Commune of York. As soon as the writer saw him, he told the Mayor that he would neither sit nor remain in the place where John de Charleton was, and he rose and went out, for he would certainly never make peace with the said John without the consent of the commonalty of London. He had not been in the company of the merchants since and had no certain knowledge what answer they made to the King's Council. Accordingly he prays the City to put aside its anger against him. Dated at York, 12 Feb. In a postscript he adds that the Mayor of York and several other burgesses of York came to his lodging on the eve of the Purification and accused him of having come to York only to spy on their fellow-burgess, John de Charletone, in order to do him harm, all of which he had denied. The writer considered that this insult (vileynie) was directed not only against himself but also against the City, whose messenger he was. (F)"

Cambs. The plaintiffs had alleged that the men of the hundred had allowed the robbers to escape, to which the men of the hundred had replied that within fifteen days several evildoers had been apprehended and placed in the King's prison at Cambridge, on account of which the hundred was not bound to answer for the robbery. A precept had been sent to the Mayor and Bailiffs of Cambridge and a certificate returned, and the parties had appeared in Chancery, being subsequently ordered to come before the King in Parliament at Salisbury, and by adjournment before Geoffrey le Scrope and the other Justices in the King's Bench. The men of the hundred, represented by William Avenel, knight, and others, averred that the returns of the Sheriff, the Coroners and the Mayor and Bailiffs of Cambridge [saying that no persons suspected of the robbery had been apprehended] were false, and that as a matter of fact Ralph le Thresher and other thieves had been arrested and detained at Cambridge.

Roll A 1b: (iii) Aug 1328 - Aug 1335,Membr. 31,1328/12/16,"Letter from the King to the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs and Commonalty of London, informing them that he had recently sent to the Earl of Lancaster certain messages, a copy of which accompanies this letter. On receiving the messages the Earl had replied that he would take advice and give an answer, but instead of doing so he had moved from Leicester to Kenilworth and was now advancing in force against the King, to whom he would have done an injury, if he could have taken him unawares. Though the Earl and his party declared that they were acting in the King's interests, and that their movements were directed not against him, but against certain of his subjects, the King considered that their proceedings would result in grave disorder, and thus directly affected him. In any case, it was not their duty, but his, to act as judge and do justice. He appeals to the City, which he regards as the ""King's Chamber,"" not to show favour to the Earl or assist him in any way. He desires the Mayor to proclaim publicly the tenour of the messages which he had sent to the Earl. Dated at Gloucester, 16 Dec. Ao 2 Edw. III [1328]. (F) Copy of the above-mentioned messages: Recently Ralph Basset and William de Clynton had come to the King at Westminster and had suggested that an agreement was possible if the Earl of Lancaster and the Earl of March (fn. 21) could discuss their differences together, and had prayed the King to give orders to his Council to arrange a meeting. To this the King had answered that the measures taken by the Earl of Lancaster were a trespass against himself, and amends should be made to him alone. Though it was not a King's duty to send messengers to his subjects, nevertheless for the preservation of the peace, he now informs the Earl of the following points on which he feels himself aggrieved, in order that the Earl may be better disposed to make his submission. In the first place, it was agreed at the Parliament of Northampton (fn. 22) by the prelates and wise men of the Council, and by them proposed to the King, the Earls and other magnates, that the King was the rightful heir of France according to written and Canon law, and he was advised to send two Bishops to France to claim his right. By general consent, to which the Earl of Lancaster was a party, the Bishops of Chester and Worcester were chosen, and thereupon the Earl and those present in Parliament promised to aid the King to the utmost of their power. Item, it was agreed at the same Parliament that Justices should be commissioned for the several counties to deal with felonies and trespasses, that the magnates in their districts should assist them to do justice and should not maintain or protect evildoers, and that no one, great or small, should go armed in the Kingdom, under penalty of forfeiture of their arms and imprisonment. Item, it was agreed that the King should live of his own; and forthwith a Chancellor, Treasurer, Steward of the Household and other ministers were appointed. It was also agreed that the Earl of Lancaster should remain near the King to counsel and aid him, and that no important business should be done without the Earl—which duties the Earl undertook loyally to perform."
Roll A 1b: (iii) Aug 1328 - Aug 1335,Membr. 31b,1328/12/16,"Nevertheless, in spite of these ordinances and promises the Earl had removed himself from the King and his Council, except on one occasion, when he came to the King at Warwick and promised to attend the Council at Worcester. But at Worcester the Earl was unwilling that the dispatch of men to Guyenne should take place until the matter had been considered at a larger Council, which he advised the King to summon to York (fn. 23). The Earl, however, had not attended at York, sending letters to excuse himself, with the result that the business of Gascony and other important matters were delayed, whereupon the King took the advice of those who were present and summoned Parliament to meet at Salisbury, to which place he arranged his journey by way of Lincoln, Norfolk and London. On the way the Earl had appeared at Barlyngs (fn. 24) with a retinue of armed and mounted men, to the great displeasure of the King, who ordered him by word of mouth to attend the Parliament at Salisbury. After his departure, the Earl sent the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Wake to the Guildhall of London, in which City there was always a large number of visiting aliens, and these messengers, in the presence of the Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen and the whole Commonalty and also of many aliens (fn. 25), declared that the King was badly advised, had no good council round him, had not the wherewithal to live, and paid nothing for the expenses of his household—all of which was reported abroad, at the Court of Rome and in France and elsewhere, to the great slander of the King and his Council and in hindrance of the King's affairs in France and Gascony. After this, the Earl assembled men-at-arms at Hegham Ferers (fn. 26), news of which was carried to the King at Cambridge (fn. 27). In order to avoid the Earl he had turned aside from his journey to London and had joined the Queen-Mother and the Queen, staying in their company till Salisbury was reached. The Earl did not attend the Parliament there, but sent certain knights as his proctors to lay before the King his reasons for not coming—which reasons seemed to many in Parliament invalid. However, the Bishops, who did not wish to say openly that the excuses given were unacceptable, prayed the King not to accept them for the time being, but to wait quietly till the whole Council was met together; their reasons being that the Bishop of Winchester was not present among the other prelates when the Earl of Lancaster's non-arrival was discussed. Subsequently the Bishop appeared and told the prelates, earls and barons that he knew well that the Earl had not come because of the quarrel between himself and Lord Mortimer. The Earl had heard, he said, that Lord Mortimer had made peace in Scotland, in order to destroy him (the Earl). The Bishop added that if an agreement could be reached between the Earl and Mortimer all would be well. These remarks were reported to the King, in whose presence Lord Mortimer, now Earl of March, had defended himself from the Bishop's aspersions. The prelates and others there were satisfied with his defence, and afterwards by the King's command and at the request of the prelates, earls and barons in Parliament, Mortimer took an oath on the cross of the Archbishop of Canterbury that he would neither do, nor procure to be done, any harm to the Earl of Lancaster and his party. On the prayer of the prelates, the Bishops of Winchester and London were sent to the Earl to report these events to him, and to invite him to attend Parliament, the King adding a verbal message that he wished the Earl and his party to come in safety, though he did not desire the presence of Sir Henry de Beaumond (fn. 28) on this occasion, and that if the Earl distrusted any person of the King's entourage, the King would give him surety. Meanwhile these delays and the upholding of business were regarded as a great hardship by those attending Parliament, especially as they had been put to great expense on previous occasions, when nothing was done. However, the Bishops returned at length with the Earl's answer to the following effect: The Earl denied that he was moved by any desire to profit himself, or by any hatred of others, and declared that it was in the interest of the Church, the King and the realm, that certain abuses should be remedied. The King ought to have enough of his own to live fitly, without oppressing the people, together with treasure for defending his land and people if need arose. Moreover the Queen-consort ought to have her dowry on which to live without grieving the people (fn. 29). Peers of the realm had been chosen at the Parliament at Westminster after the King's coronation to advise him during his youthful years, which counsellors were to be responsible for their actions to the next Parliament. The peace of the realm, without which the King could not be lord or King, ought to be maintained. In order to recommend these matters and give such assistance as he could, the Earl would come to Parliament, but he begged the prelates and others to excuse him to the King for coming with an armed force, since his motive for so doing was not any desire to disobey the King or to harm any one, but merely to protect himself against those who were notoriously anxious to do him a wrong. If the King considered that he should come in any other wise, because of the danger of conflict, he prayed the prelates and magnates to obtain from the King letters of safe-conduct for himself and his party. The above answer being considered by the King, it seemed to him as regards the first point, namely, that he ought to live of his own, that it was impossible for him to be any richer, since both he and his people were impoverished by the present disturbances, but if any man knew how to make him richer, it would give him and his advisers great satisfaction. As regards the Queen-consort's dowry, this ought not to be a reason for disturbance, since the matter concerned himself and her alone. It would not be an increased charge, and so he was willing that it should be done. As to the point that the King should be counselled by the peers of the realm, summons had frequently been sent to the Earl, but he had been unwilling to come and had removed himself from the King. As regards the maintenance of the law and peace, this was the sovereign desire of the King himself, and he wished above all things to maintain them, as he was bound by his oath to do. In the matter of the safe-conduct, though it was not customary for Kings in the past to issue such letters to their subjects in the realm, nevertheless at the request of the Queen-Mother, the prelates, the King's uncle the Earl of Kent, and others, the King had granted them in the form demanded, under the condition that the Earl and his party would answer at law, since the King could not issue any other kind of safe-conduct without offence to the Great Charter, which laid down that the King should not deny or delay right or justice to any man. These letters of safe-conduct were not accepted by the Earl, nor did he attend Parliament. Accordingly the King, in view of the long delays which had taken place, with the assent of the prelates, earls and barons, and at the request of the knights of the Commons, on Monday the eve of All Saints [1 Nov.] adjourned his Parliament to the octave of the Purification next ensuing at Westminster. He then arranged to make his journey by Winchester to London, when news was brought to him that the Earl of Lancaster with others had entered the City of Winchester with a great force of men-at-arms and foot-men, and had gathered to himself large numbers of men in a warlike manner. Thereupon the King ordered the Sheriff of Southampton to hasten to Winchester in order to arrest all men carrying arms against the King's prohibition and the Statute of Northampton. The Sheriff conveyed his orders to Lord Wake, but the Earl's party stood their ground and did not obey the King's servant until the Thursday following, although the Parliament was adjourned and the members had departed on leave, On Thursday the King journeyed as arranged to Winchester, when the Earl and his armed following left the City and passed by the side of the King, which was seen by some of the King's household, who told him what they saw—an action which the King regarded with great displeasure as being done against the peace and his own honour, and in despite of him. Nevertheless the King, being anxious that peace should be maintained, desires to bring all these facts to the notice of the Earl, that the Earl may be advised to behave towards the King as he ought to behave to his liege lord. The King assures the Earl that if he does so, he will find him gracious and ready to promote unity and concord between all as a just judge, and not as a partisan. (F)"

Moreover the King well knew that divers councils of the prelates of the realm had given sentence of excommunication against all persons (with the exception of the King, the Queen and their children) who were guilty of disturbing the peace, or causing it to be disturbed. Since it was now common knowledge that the King had been advised to advance in force against certain peers and others of the land, to the great peril of the realm, the Archbishop earnestly prays and admonishes the King to desist from these intentions until the meeting of Parliament at Westminster, at which any peer or other who had offended might make amends and be punished according to due process of law.

Excuses are to be made for the non-attendance of the Chancellor, who is in charge of the Great Seal and cannot be spared from his duties. Those present are to be informed that the King had received information that the King of France intended to send military aid to the Scots, and this information had been confirmed by the fact that ships had been pressed into service along the French shores as far as the coast of Brittany for transporting troops. Since there was danger of these ships making a descent upon the English coast, the King and Council had appointed Sir John Howard as Admiral from the mouth of the Thames northwards, and Sir John de Cobham from the same place southwards, and in addition had constituted certain persons as wardens of the maritime counties, and others to enlist and command defensive forces, as would appear by their commissions. Commands had also been sent to the Barons of the Cinque Ports and the authorities of other ports to put their towns in a posture of defence, and commissioners had been sent to the seaports to ensure that this was being done. News had also been received that at the Parliament of Paris held on the Octave of St Mary Magdalene [22 July] last, the King of France had announced by word of mouth that he desired to aid the Scots with a thousand men-at-arms and a large number of other troops, and a suitable escort of ships, pretending that he was bound so to do by virtue of a perpetual treaty of alliance between the two kingdoms. Writs had immediately been issued to summon the bishops and others to London to discuss the contents of the writs and other matters, which would be laid before them by the King's messengers. The Chancellor, Treasurer and other councillors, in order to facilitate the discussion of these matters by the prelates and nobles, had divided the kingdom into three parts: from the Trent northwards including the county of Lincoln; from the Trent southwards; and the Marches of Wales. They had summoned the prelates etc. from the first part to meet at York, where it was agreed that all men of a certain age should be armed, and should resist any landing of the French, in whichever of the three parts it should occur. Sir Ralph Basset had then been ordered to take a commission issued to the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, Hereford and Worcester, Sir John de Cherleton and himself to hold a similar council for the Marches of Wales; and afterwards to come to London to explain what had been done at York and in Wales, so that the Council at London, which represented that part of England from the Trent southwards, might give its consent or add anything necessary, in order that the measures adopted might be carried out unanimously. Further orders had been given to the Admirals, the Barons of the Cinque Ports, and the men of other ports, to fit out and put afloat their ships for the protection of the coasts; and three chief captains, one from each part of the kingdom, had been chosen and commissioned for the purpose.

The Mayor and Aldermen being dissatisfied with the verdict, which they considered to be unreasonable and untrue, adjourned the matter and took counsel together as to the best course to pursue.

The ordinance having been read in the presence of the cappers aforesaid, a certain Richard de Byry, a capper, shouted out that he would continue to do as he had done before, in spite of it; and he was thereupon committed to Newgate.

Roll A 6: 1349-50,Membr. 7,1350/06/28,"Pleas held before the Mayor, Aldermen and Sheriffs on Monday the eve of SS. Peter and Paul [29 June] A bill of complaint was read in which the Commonalty of the land (la Comune de la terre) (fn. 15) charged the Fusters of the City, viz. Geoffrey Owyt, John Dunmowe, Thomas Payn, Robert Payn, John de Enfeld, Walter Brok, John Payn and Peter Dunmowe, with forming a confederacy and agreeing not to sell a saddle-tree (arson), which used to cost 6d or 7d, for less than 2s or 30d, although the wood of which it was made cost only 3d. They complained further that the Fusters had agreed not to take any apprentices, with the intention of restricting the number of their mistery, so that they could control prices. They also agreed to sell their saddle-bows to foreigners, if they could not obtain their price among citizens, and they were about to buy a charter from the King restricting the trade to those persons who were now confederated, which would result in the decrease of the mistery. A similar confederacy had formerly existed among the lorimers in copper, of whom there were now only two left to serve the whole people. (F) The Fusters were attached to appear on Wednesday, when they pleaded not guilty, and one of them, Robert Payn, said he had taken an apprentice, Nicholas de Eston, and enrolled him within the last half year. On Friday a jury found that the Fusters were selling saddle-trees for 40d, though wood cost no more than formerly, that they had agreed in words, though not on oath, to raise the price of their work and to sell to foreigners if citizens would not buy, but that they were not guilty of refusing apprentices or seeking a charter. Judgment was given that they be committed to prison during the pleasure of the Mayor and Aldermen. (L) On Monday after the Feast of the Translation of St Thomas the Martyr [7 July] the above-mentioned Fusters came into court, when William Pykerel on behalf of the Saddlers of the City produced a bill purporting to be an agreement by the good men of the Commonalty of the land, who had prosecuted the Fusters. They suggested that owing to the mischief caused by the Pestilence during the last two years, a new scale of charges for goods supplied by the Fusters to the Saddlers should be adopted for a half year, one year or two years, and that prices should revert to the former level or even lower as times (le seclee) improved. They demanded further that all saddle-trees should be of good material, that the Fusters should take apprentices, and that they should not sell to foreigners so long as there was a sale among citizens. (F) After deliberating on these proposals of the Saddlers, the Fusters handed in a bill, in which they said that owing to a life of labour they were now feeble in strength, that they could not find apprentices or serving men to help them, and that at a time when they needed more comfort in the matter of food and clothing, conditions were so evil that the gallon of beer cost 2d instead of 1d, and other necessaries had also risen in like proportion. Consequently they could not sell at the prices suggested by the Saddlers, since they would be spending more in a year than they could earn in three. As regards selling to foreigners and citizens, they possessed the same rights as other freemen, and the proposals of the Saddlers were in prejudice of their liberties. They prayed the Mayor and Aldermen to accept a schedule of prices for certain kinds of saddle-trees. (F) After consideration, and putting aside the arguments of both the Saddlers and the Fusters, the Mayor and Aldermen ordained certain prices for three kinds of saddle-trees, which were to be paid until affairs improved. These prices were accepted both by the Saddlers and the Fusters, and the latter swore to observe them.

The son had leased the property for six years to William de Salisbury, goldsmith, and had since died. Though the term of six years had expired and the property should have passed to the plaintiff, the tenant refused to surrender possession. (F) The defendant appeared on summons and pleaded that the said Alice had already had possession and had conveyed the property to him and his assigns during the term of her own life. The plaintiff denied this. In order to have the issue between the parties more clearly defined, the defendant was examined, whereupon he admitted that the plaintiff had made him no grant.

Roll A 9: 1363-64,Membr. 7,1364/09/04,"Pleas held before the Mayor and Aldermen 4 Sept. A o 38 Edw. III [1364] John atte Ram of "" Baynardescastel"" brought a letter under the Privy Seal, dated at the King's Manor of "" Yeshampsted (fn. 12),"" enclosing a petition sent to Sir William de Wikham (fn. 13). The writ ordered the Mayor and Aldermen to call before them an action of debt moved in the Sheriffs' Court by Peter de Mildenhale against John atte Ram for £40, and to assist the latter by way of equity and good faith (par voie de equite & de bon foy). The petition, which was written by John atte Ram, set forth that Peter de Mildenhale had contracted a loan of £20 (fist une chevaunce de xxli) to a certain Philip le Walisshe, who received ermine supposed to be of that value, but when the said Philip came to sell it, a confederate of Peter only allowed him £14 in cash for it (fn. 14). In order to obtain the loan at all, Philip had to find two sureties in £40, namely a certain John Monde and the petitioner. Subsequently the said Peter had sued the petitioner as surety for £40, and had been awarded by the Court a white longcloth value 8 marks, and had caused John Monde to be attached in Newgate, until Sir Nicholas de Lovaigne had undertaken to pay the debt. Nevertheless he had again sued the petitioner in the Sheriffs' Court, and the petitioner, having no reasonable warning and being without a counsel or advice, had in his ignorance denied the obligation, as a result of which he was in danger of ruin. Accordingly the petitioner prayed Sir William de Wykham to order the Recorder to examine the matter, so that it might be shown to be a usurious bargain, for which the said Peter had already received part payment; and in any case all liability had been assumed by Sir Nicholas de Lovaigne for John Monde (fn. 15), wherefore the petitioner ought to be discharged from the suit. (F) On receipt of these letters, the Mayor and Aldermen summoned the parties, who appeared. Peter de Mildenhale denied the allegations made against him and demanded to acquit himself by the verdict of a jury. Subsequently the petitioner failed to appear, but the Court decided to take the verdict in his absence. The jury found the said Peter not guilty as regards the articles contained in the petition.
