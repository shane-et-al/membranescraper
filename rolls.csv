The merchants estimated that the change would benefit the commonalty of the realm to the extent of 20s a sack, and they had chosen two merchants as their attorneys to pursue the matter in Parliament. On the other hand, the writers, representing London, and the merchants of York, Lincoln, Winchester and Bristol were opposed to the removal of the Staple. In order not to incur the enmity of the King and his Council by their disagreement, and because they wished to be further advised by the City, they had prayed that their answer might be delayed until the meeting of Parliament, which would take place on Monday after Candlemas. Accordingly they request that the ""Commune"" might be summoned, and the result of their deliberations sent by letter to York on the aforesaid Monday. As regards news from the North, the writers had none to communicate. Written at York on Saturday before the Purification B.M. [2 Feb.]. (F) "
Roll A 1b: (ii) Nov 1327 - July 1328,Membr. 17 (20),1328-02-04,"  The City's reply to the above. They had unanimously agreed that it was best that the Staple should remain in England and this was to be strenuously urged by John de Grantham and John Priour. Rather than that the Staple should be removed across the sea and a Mayor of the Staple appointed there, it was better that every merchant should be allowed to trade where he liked. A letter had been sent to the Mayor and Commonalty of York to uphold the City's representatives and to prevent the removal of the Staple, and another letter had been despatched to Richard de Betoyne, enjoining him to do nothing against their assent and the assent of the Commonalty of the City. Dated on Thursday after the Purification B.M. [2 Feb.]. (F)"

Roll A 1b: (ii) Nov 1327 - July 1328,Membr. 19 (23),1328-02-04,"  Answer to the above. The City was strongly in favour of keeping the Staple in England and had notified its wishes to Richard de Betoyne, who had acted throughout entirely on his own account, and not with the assent of the City.

The said Andrew was sitting in the house of John Roger of Hastings, when Henry Alard came with three companions and began asking him questions as to whence he came and whether he knew Adam Lucas of London. Upon his saying he did know the person named, he was villainously abused by Alard and his companions, who afterwards lay in wait for him outside the town and maltreated him. By beating his hack (son hakeneye) he was fortunately able to escape back to Hastings, where he remained badly wounded until friends helped him to take a safe road home. Dated 14 Feb. (F) "

Roll A 1b: (ii) Nov 1327 - July 1328,Membr. 19 (23)b,1328-02-12,"  Letter from John de Grantham and John Priour, junior, to the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs and Commonalty of London, reporting that they had done their best to carry out instructions at York, but the will of the King and his Council were independent of the advice of the people. The writers understood that the City believed, on the strength of a letter from the Mayor of York, that Richard Betoyne (fn. 31) had advocated the removal of the Staple abroad, and claimed by a charter the office of Mayor of the Staple overseas. They wish to testify that the said Richard attended an assembly of the ""Commune"" of merchants in the Chapter House at York, at which the writers and Richard de Edelmeton, William atte Pole and other merchants from 28 towns were present, when they discussed the Staple, as they were instructed to do by the Chancellor. The merchants had put it to Richard de Betoyne that he was their Mayor and he had denied it (susmistrent au dit Richard de Bettoyne estre lour metre et il respoundit qe noun), whereupon they answered him that he ought to go and lay down his mayoralty in the place where he took it up, and surrender the charters, which had cost them dear. To this he replied that John de Charletone (fn. 32) had the charter of their franchises and detained it, but that he had himself, four years ago, caused a transcript to be made, which he was ready to surrender if they wished. At this point, the Mayor of York suddenly appeared, hand in hand with John de Charletone, with three or four others of their party and several members of the Commune of York, on which Richard de Betoyne said he would not stay in any place where John de Charletone was taken into counsel, and he got up and left and did not return to the Council of the merchants. For this reason Richard de Edelmeton and the rest were angry with him. This was all that happened, and the writers have no knowledge of any misconduct on the part of Richard de Betoyne, and are grieved that stories to his discredit should have been reported by the Mayor of York. On the contrary they had found the said Richard always zealous to carry out the wishes of the City. As regards news, they report the arrival of the French envoys, who had not given any answer. The Scottish envoys were on the way, and the Council was sitting daily to promote an agreement among the magnates. Letters had come to the King and Queen, announcing the death of the King of France. Dated at York, 12 Feb. (F)"
Roll A 1b: (ii) Nov 1327 - July 1328,Membr. 20 (24),1328-02-12,"  Letter from Richard de Betoyne to the same, reporting that he had done his best to carry out the duty entrusted to him, but he had been much hurt by the accusations made against him to the City of London by the Mayor of York. He had only been in the company of the merchants at York on one occasion, when they put it to him that he was Mayor of the Staple (mistrent sur que ieo fu meire de les Estaples) and wished to have counsel with him, and he had answered that he did not consider himself their Mayor, and had not come to counsel them, but that John de Graham (fn. 33) and John Priour were present, in accordance with the writs, to deal with the matter of the Staple. The merchants then charged him by the oath he had taken overseas that he should go abroad and lay down his mayoralty in the place where he had received it, together with their charters and muniments, which had cost them dear. He had replied that he had left the charters on the other side of the sea with their other things on his departure thence, except their charter of the franchises of the Staples, purchased from the late King, which was in the hands of John de Charleton, who detained it, but he had had a copy made at Dover in the 18th year of King Edward, the King's father, when the latter was at that place; and he offered it to the merchants. He encloses a copy for the information of the City of London. As a proof of the ill-will entertained towards him by the men of York, he mentions that the Mayor of York appeared maliciously and without warning, with four or five of his livery, and led in his enemy, John de Charletone, dressed in their livery as a burgess of York, and with them were a great many of the Commune of York. As soon as the writer saw him, he told the Mayor that he would neither sit nor remain in the place where John de Charleton was, and he rose and went out, for he would certainly never make peace with the said John without the consent of the commonalty of London. He had not been in the company of the merchants since and had no certain knowledge what answer they made to the King's Council. Accordingly he prays the City to put aside its anger against him. Dated at York, 12 Feb. In a postscript he adds that the Mayor of York and several other burgesses of York came to his lodging on the eve of the Purification and accused him of having come to York only to spy on their fellow-burgess, John de Charletone, in order to do him harm, all of which he had denied. The writer considered that this insult (vileynie) was directed not only against himself but also against the City, whose messenger he was. (F) "

Complaint had been made that merchants, foreign and native, had been bringing into the country counterfeit sterling worth only sixteen shillings of true sterling; that goldsmiths of the City were keeping shop in obscure lanes, where they bought vessels of gold and silver without inquiry and melted them down into plate for export, or made out of them coronals, buckles and rings set with glass counterfeited to represent stones, and that they put too much alloy in their silver articles, which they sold to mercers; and further that the cutlers plated tin with silver, so that the two could not be separated, and sold this plated tin as silver.
